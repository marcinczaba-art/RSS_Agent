# RSS_Agent

RSS_Agent is an automated weekly RSS reader and article ranking system designed for microbial oceanography, biogeochemistry, systems biology, and computational biology. It fetches articles, ranks them using an LLM, filters top results, archives previous weeks, and emails you a curated list.

## Features

- Fetches articles from RSS/Atom feeds listed in `feeds.txt`
- Prevents re-processing by storing previously-seen article IDs in `cache/seen_ids.json`
- Combines title + abstract (`content`) for ranking
- Filters results by threshold or top N
- Outputs weekly results in `curated_latest.md`
- Automatically archives last week’s results as `curated_YYYYMMDD.md`
- Automatically emails weekly curated results
- Fully automated via GitHub Actions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrcasey/RSS_Agent
cd RSS_Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

Create the required directories:

```bash
mkdir -p cache
```

Create a `feeds.txt` file in the project root, one feed URL per line.

## Email Setup

To send weekly results by email, set the following secrets in GitHub:

- `SMTP_HOST` – e.g. smtp.gmail.com  
- `SMTP_PORT` – usually 587  
- `SMTP_USER` – your email login  
- `SMTP_PASS` – **an SMTP app password**

### What is an SMTP app password?

Some email providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) block regular passwords for automated scripts.  
An **SMTP app password** is a special password you generate for a specific application.  
You use it instead of your real password when sending mail programmatically.

For Gmail:

1. Enable 2‑factor authentication  
2. Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords  
3. Create a new app password  
4. Use that password as `SMTP_PASS`

## Running Manually

```bash
python scripts/run_all.py
```

## Automating with GitHub Actions

A workflow file (`.github/workflows/rss_agent.yml`) is provided.  
It:

- Runs weekly
- Fetches and ranks new articles
- Archives the last week’s results
- Emails the new curated list
- Commits updates to the repo

Ensure you configure repository secrets before enabling the workflow.

## Output

- `curated_latest.md` — most recent curated articles  
- `archive/curated_YYYYMMDD.md` — archived weekly snapshot  
- `cache/seen_ids.json` — tracking previously processed article IDs  
- `cache/ranked_results.json` — full ranking logs
