One limiting factor for microbial growth on cheese surfaces is iron availability. To better understand the role of iron acquisition in cheese microbial ecology, we investigated the diversity and distribution of iron uptake systems across a wide range of cheeses. We analysed 136 metagenomes and 1400 genomes and Metagenome\u2010Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from 44 French Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses. Using an updated set of Hidden Markov Models targeting iron acquisition genes, we identified a wide diversity of iron uptake systems. Siderophore biosynthesis and import systems were more prevalent in surface\u2010associated species than in those from the cheese core. About 20 different siderophore biosynthesis pathways were detected, with desferrioxamine and enterobactin\u2010type being the most prevalent. Genomic analyses revealed the main bacterial and fungal producers, including Glutamicibacter, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Penicillium. While siderophore biosynthesis pathways were found in a minority of MAGs, iron/siderophore import systems were widespread, suggesting the potential for cross\u2010feeding interactions involving siderophores. These findings enhance our understanding of microbial interactions in cheese and open perspectives for improving ripening cultures by considering iron acquisition traits."

    "content": "Abstract\nWave frictional dissipation is a key process in rough seabed\u2019s environments such as coral reefs, expected to significantly reduce incoming wave energy. In phase\u2010averaged models, wave dissipation is typically estimated through a wave friction factor fw ${f}_{w}$ which is dependent of the near\u2010bed orbital excursion and the hydraulic length, a proxy for the seabed substrate roughness. A field experiment was conducted in the South\u2010Western coral reef barrier of Mayotte (Indian Ocean) to compute fw ${f}_{w}$ through a frequency\u2010integrated wave energy balance. Significant time and space variations of fw ${f}_{w}$ have been observed, driven by the evolution of the wavefield and the diversity of coral geometry and scales found along the barrier. The fine reef architecture has been examined thanks to a high\u2010resolution multi\u2010beam echo sounder survey. This study has reassessed the established link between hydraulic roughness length ks ${k}_{s}$ and roughness standard deviation; it also indicates that second\u2010order roughness metrics may also significantly explain variations in ks ${k}_{s}$. Future challenges remain in the proper definition of the length scales of seabed variability attributed to roughness and to bathymetry."

By modelling resource consumption and species interactions, we show that density\u2010dependent mortality expands coexistence zones and explains variable productivity\u2013diversity relationships.

Negative density dependence is often utilised in complex ecosystem models, typically as a density\u2010dependent mortality term for a population, but its full impact on community structure remains unclear. Here we use mechanistic population models of resource consumption to examine the effects of negative density dependence and develop a tractable framework for understanding diversity patterns in complex systems. To provide mechanistic grounding, we quantify how density\u2010dependent mortality expands coexistence zones along resource gradients in simple communities using graphical analysis. We then derive an analytical formula relating species abundances and coexistence patterns to trait differences among subsets (guilds) of complex communities, in which many species share a resource or predator. Finally, we explain how distinct relationships between productivity and diversity emerge from the resulting mechanistic framework, providing insights into previously unreconciled observed patterns."

    "content": "This study shows that when two spider mite species evolve separately on tomato plants hyperaccumulating cadmium\u2014a stressful environment\u2014their adaptation leads to reduced competition between them and increased intraspecific competition. As a result, instead of one species excluding the other, both can coexist. This demonstrates that evolution in response to abiotic stress can unexpectedly promote species coexistence and influence community diversity, even when species evolve in isolation.\n\nABSTRACT\nAdaptation to abiotic stresses generally relies on traits that are not independent from those affecting species interactions. Still, the impact of such evolutionary processes on coexistence remains elusive. Here, we studied two spider mite species evolving separately on tomato plants that hyper\u2010accumulated cadmium, a stressful environment for herbivores, or on plants without cadmium. Through experimental evolution and structural stability theory, we found that both species coexist in the cadmium environment, but the evolution of a single species in cadmium leads to exclusion. However, when both species evolve in cadmium they can coexist. This shift occurred due to a simultaneous increase in intra and a decrease in interspecific competition in that environment. These predictions were further confirmed with complementary experiments of population dynamics. Therefore, population shifts to novel environments, even in the absence of interspecific competitors, may have unforeseen evolutionary consequences for community composition and the maintenance of species diversity."

    "content": "<p>by Marika Constant, Elisa Filevich, Pascal Mamassian</p>\n\nAccording to the Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. While it is generally assumed that priors influence both decisions and confidence in the same way, previous work has found priors to have a stronger impact at the confidence level, challenging this assumption. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants\u2019 confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed tilted moving-line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions \u2013 one in which the prior impacted discrimination performance, and one in which it did not. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced discrimination decisions, even after accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to be best explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This is in agreement with a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a greater influence on the metacognitive level than on perceptual decisions."

    "content": "<p>by Nishant Joshi, Sven van Der Burg, Tansu Celikel, Fleur Zeldenrust</p>\n\nNeuronal classification based on morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular markers is often considered static. Here, we challenge this view, showing that functional classification depends on input patterns. Using single-cell recordings from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons in mice, we compared responses to step-and-hold versus dynamic frozen noise inputs that mimic presynaptic activity. Action potential and waveform-based classifications varied significantly, highlighting the dynamic nature of neuronal identity. To assess the contribution of input versus neuronal attributes toward classification, we analyzed four attribute sets, namely action potential, passive biophysical, adaptation currents, and linear input filters derived via spike-triggered averages (STA). Our findings revealed that the STA, which captures a neuron\u2019s selective responsiveness to presynaptic activity, explained the most variance within the population. This highlights input-driven dynamics as key to functional identity, emphasizing the need for physiologically relevant inputs in defining neuronal classes and shifting the focus from static properties to dynamic functional diversity."

    "content": "<p>by Romain Enjalbert, Jakub K\u00f6ry, Timm Kr\u00fcger, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>\n\nThe tumour microvasculature is abnormal, and as a consequence oxygen and drug transport to the tumour tissue is impaired. The abnormal microvasculature contributes to tumour tissue hypoxia, as well as to varying drug penetration depth in the tumour. Many anti-cancer treatments require the presence of oxygen to be fully efficacious, however the question of how well oxygen concentration overlaps with drug concentration is not elucidated, which could compromise the therapeutic effect of these drugs. In this work we use a computational model of blood flow and oxygen transport, and develop a model for an oxygen-dependent drug, T-DM1, to study the overlap of oxygen and drug concentration in tumour tissue, where we model both compressed and uncompressed vessels in the tumour. Our results show that, due to the compressed vessels present in tumours, areas of sufficient oxygen concentration for a drug to function overlap poorly with areas of sufficient drug concentration, covering 28% of the tumour tissue, compared to 82% in healthy tissue. The reduction in drug and oxygen overlap is due to the altered red blood cell dynamics through the abnormal microvasculature, and indicates that drug transport to tumours should not be considered independently of oxygen transport in cases where the drug requires oxygen to function."

    "content": "Remarkably, human brains have the ability to accurately perceive and process the real-world size of objects, despite vast differences in distance and perspective. While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties \u2013 such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size \u2013 are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models."

    "content": "In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals for supervised learning at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. It has not been tested so far whether CF signaling may also influence plasticity in other brain areas. Here, we show that optogenetic CF activation suppresses potentiation of whisker responses in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex of awake mice that is observed after repeated whisker stimulation. Using two-photon imaging and chemogenetics, we find that CFs control plasticity by modulating SST- and VIP-positive interneurons in S1 cortex. Transsynaptic labeling identifies zona incerta (ZI) to thalamic posterior medial nucleus projections as a pathway for cerebellar output reaching S1 cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of PV-positive neurons in the ZI prevents CF co-activation effects, identifying the ZI as a critical relay. Our findings demonstrate that CFs impact sensory signal processing and plasticity in S1 cortex and thus may convey instructive signals."

    "content": "Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and two-photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha retinal ganglion cells (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (types 5i, 6, and 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways."

    "content": "Neural lamination is a common feature of the CNS, with several subcellular structures, such as adherens junctions (AJs), playing a role in this process. The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli."

Using seasonal forecasts, this study investigates the modulation of the North Atlantic response to SSWs by El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Forecast systems reproduce the tropospheric variability following SSWs found in reanalysis, including an increase of events followed by a poleward\u2010positioned jet during La Ni\u00f1a winters.

Regionally, emissions were underestimated in northern Africa (\u223c0.25\u00a0PgC\u00a0yr\u22121) due to missing burned area and overestimated in southern Africa (\u223c0.05\u00a0PgC\u00a0yr\u22121) due to inflated fuel assumptions. The inversion reduces inter\u2010inventory discrepancies by 88% and reveals pronounced landscape\u2010dependent biases. These findings highlight the potential of XCO2\u2010based joint inversions to enhance regional emission estimates and improve representations of fire\u2013carbon\u2013climate feedbacks in Earth system models."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study, using the peak electron density of Ionospheric F\u2010region from the Global\u2010scale Observations of the Limb and Disk reports, for the first time, a unique phenomenon: the rapid reversal of the intensity of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) crests between the hemispheres during the main phase of 23 April 2023, geomagnetic storm. The Prompt Penetration Electric Field amplified the intensity of both EIA crests. However, the enhancement at the southern crest began to decay within an hour, while the northern crest began to strengthen. Thermosphere\u2010Ionosphere\u2010Electrodynamics General Circulation Model simulations indicate that trans\u2010equatorial wind played a key role in these variations. Wavelet periodograms of ground\u2010based Total Electron Content measurements confirmed the presence of Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs). Storm\u2010induced winds and TIDs likely changed the altitude of the F\u2010peaks and the recombination rates between crests, and plasma transport by trans\u2010equatorial winds also contributed to this rare phenomenon."

    "content": "Abstract\nGroundwater from the Leizhou Peninsula in tropical South China provides one of the first noble\u2010gas based paleoclimate reconstructions from the East Asian monsoon region. Radiocarbon dating establishes a robust chronology spanning the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Noble gas temperatures reveal a minimum glacial\u2010to\u2010Holocene warming of \u223c5\u00b0C\u20136\u00b0C, consistent with global low\u2010latitude groundwater records. Stable isotopes (\u03b418O) covary with excess air, indicating that they primarily reflect monsoon\u2010driven precipitation changes rather than temperature. These records point to suppressed recharge during the Last Glacial Maximum, a short\u2010lived weakening of the summer monsoon during the Younger Dryas, and intensified precipitation in the early Holocene. By jointly resolving temperature and precipitation signals, fossil groundwater offers a dual constraint on tropical paleoclimate that complements existing continental records and provides benchmarks for testing climate model sensitivity in East Asia."

    "content": "Metabolite-protein interactions (MPIs) are essential for coordinating cellular metabolism and signaling. Yet, MPIs remain incompletely characterized due to the limited scalability of experimental methods and the complexity of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms. Existing computational approaches often focus on direct interactions and overlook higher order associations and effect of drug perturbations. Here we introduce TopoMPI, a graph-based framework that integrates five types of biological relationships, namely, metabolite-metabolite (MMI), protein-protein (PPI), metabolite-protein (MPI), drug-protein (DPI), and drug-drug (DDI), into a heterogeneous network structure. It comprises three complementary sub-models targeting direct interaction prediction, high-order association discovery, and drug-protein-metabolite triplet interaction inference. Comprehensive evaluation across 24 tissue-specific MPI networks, protein-metabolite association studies, and pharmacological metabolomic datasets confirms the biological relevance, robustness, and generalizability of TopoMPI for MPI prediction with AUCs ranging from 0.79 to 0.86. TopoMPI provides a scalable framework for systems-level characterization of metabolic regulation and drug mode of action."

    "content": "Proteins are composed of combinations of 20 amino acids, and the sequences selected through evolution reflect a balance between harmful and beneficial properties that together define their compatibility. However, the general principles governing the compatibility of amino acid sequences in living cells remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated the neutrality--a measure of harmful versus beneficial properties--of simple amino acid homorepeats composed of ten identical residues (Poly10X), using yeast as an experimental model system. EGFP-Poly10X fusions were analyzed using the genetic tug-of-war (gTOW) method to quantify maximum expression levels, revealing amino-acid-specific neutrality values. Hydrophobic repeats (I, V, W, F, Y) were strongly harmful and aggregation-prone, whereas hydrophilic repeats (E, S, N, Q) alleviated harmfulness. These trends were conserved across protein backgrounds and structural contexts. Consistently, hydrophobic repeats such as Poly10I formed aggregates and were intrinsically harmful, whereas Poly10E suppressed protein aggregation and prevented activation of proteotoxic stress responses. Furthermore, analysis of PolyX occurrence across the proteomes of multiple species revealed a strong correlation between experimentally measured Poly10X neutrality and both the length and frequency of homorepeats in natural proteins. Hydrophobic amino acids were rarely observed as homorepeats, whereas residues such as E, N, Q, and S appeared frequently and were beneficial in our assays. Taken together, Poly10X neutrality serves as an experimental measure of amino acid tolerance in cells and defines the compatible sequence space of proteins. It explains the absence of certain homorepeats in nature and has implications for protein design and mutation-induced harmfulness."

    "content": "Loneliness and social isolation strongly associate with increased incidence of diabetes in humans. However, it remains unclear if lack of meaningful social interactions represents a cause or a symptom of disease. In rodents, social isolation leads to metabolic dysregulation, however the dynamics and contributing factors remain poorly understood. Here we show that single-housing young adult male mice for at least three weeks led to fasting hyperglycemia, an effect that was maintained for the duration of single-housing, but was corrected within a week of reverting mice to co-housing conditions. Single-housing did not affect glucose regulation in females. Gonadectomy experiments revealed that testicular factors induced susceptibility to social isolation, as orchiectomy prevented isolation-induced fasting hyperglycemia in males. We did not find a protective role for ovarian hormones, as ovariectomized females were as resilient as intact females to isolation-induced fasting hyperglycemia. To understand the underlying mechanisms for susceptibility to isolation, we measured plasma levels of glucoregulatory hormones. Isolation did not affect the levels of insulin, epinephrine, and corticosterone. However, glucagon levels were distinctly modulated by social isolation in intact and orchiectomized mice. Social isolation induces increased immediate early gene expression in specific neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus, a glucoregulatory brain structure that promotes glucagon release. Taken together, our findings show that testicular hormones make males susceptible to isolation-induced disruption of glucose regulation and suggest that brain glucoregulatory neurons play a role."

    "content": "Burning fossil fuels drives climate change with detrimental consequences on humankind while waste accumulation from increasing consumption threatens biosustainability globally. Gas fermentation enables to recycle carbon oxides (CO and CO2) from industrial waste gases and gasified waste into value-added products using gas-fermenting microbes, namely acetogens. However, our limited understanding of gene function and metabolic regulation is hindering rational engineering of acetogen cell factories. In this work, we identified, for the first time in acetogens, genome-wide protein-RNA interactions contributing to autotrophy in the model-acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum by combining steady-state chemostat cultivation, functional genomics, and computational methods. We first detected limited and uncoupled transcriptional and translational regulation between autotrophy and heterotrophy. Rigorous mapping of genome-wide transcriptional architecture revealed both differential usage and signal strength of transcriptional start and termination sites between genes and growth substrates. We then used computational tools to reconstruct protein-RNA interactions for differentially regulated genes predicting 14 trans-acting regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in post-transcriptional regulation and contributing to autotrophy. Most RBPs, two of which are translationally regulated, perform RNA modifications and regulate mRNA stability while others target translation-related genes. Our work provides valuable knowledge for metabolic engineering of acetogens and potentially contributes towards understanding primordial life on Earth."

    "content": "This study investigates the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to model antimicrobial re-sistance (AMR) dynamics driven by copper exposure. In a simulated environment, three agent strategies were evaluated: (1) random, (2) rule-based, and (3) Q-learning. These agents were compared to assess how varying levels of adaptability affect bacterial re-sistance to chloramphenicol and polymyxin B. The Q-learning agent consistently achieved lower resistance levels and copper burden compared to both the rule-based and random agents, demonstrating its potential for optimizing AMR management. The rule-based agent showed intermediate performance, while the random agent exhibited higher variability in resistance trajectories. This study introduces an exploratory RL framework for simulating AMR control strategies, especially in scenarios where tradition-al diagnostic tools are unavailable. The results demonstrate that RL can provide valuable insights into optimizing AMR management, particularly in settings with limited access to traditional diagnostic tools and resources."

    "content": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen, with chronic infections often associated with biofilm formation. Here, we investigate the previously uncharacterized gene PA3049, which is upregulated under biofilm conditions, to determine its role in infection, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial tolerance. We show that the small uncharacterised protein PA3049, renamed as Biofilm antibiotic tolerance Regulator (BatR), promotes biofilm establishment and enhances bacterial survival in sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Proteomic analysis revealed that BatR influences the R2/F2 pyocin cluster, which drives explosive cell lysis and extracellular DNA (eDNA) release during biofilm development. We further identify a specific interaction between BatR and PA0486 (SrkA), an uncharacterised Ser/Thr protein kinase. We show that SrkA controls biofilm and pyocyanin production, and lysis-mediated eDNA release through regulation of the R2/F2 pyocin cluster and activation of bacteriophage Pf1. Our findings support a model in which SrkA directly regulates key biofilm-associated phenotypes, while BatR acts as a modulatory partner that tunes SrkA activity under specific conditions. Finally, BatR function was tested in high validity infection models, including the ex vivo pig lung model of cystic fibrosis infection and a synthetic chronic-wound model. In these models, BatR contributes to biofilm architecture and antibiotic tolerance, and modulates pyocyanin production. Our study implicates the BatR/SrkA system in the response of P. aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic challenge in lung infections."

    "content": "Microbial interactions shape the composition and stability of the human gut microbiome. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically profiled 1,224 pairwise growth interactions among 36 representative gut bacterial strains using a spent medium assay. Most interactions were inhibitory and largely explained by resource depletion or medium acidification. We investigated further the molecular basis of a positive interaction, showing that Clostridium perfringens promotes the growth of Mediterraneibacter gnavus through extracellular vesicles. Additionally, we identified Veillonella parvula as a key species capable of modulating environmental pH, thereby enabling the growth of Parabacteroides merdae, a strain highly sensitive to acidic conditions. This pH-buffering effect was enhanced by guanine supplementation and persisted in multi-species communities containing different pH-lowering strains from diverse bacterial phyla. This demonstrates the ecological relevance of V. parvula, a species that, despite being commonly present in human gut microbiomes, is generally found at low levels. Overall, the comprehensive dataset and mechanistic insights presented here provide a foundation for rational strategies to manipulate microbiome composition and function."

    "content": "Dragon fruit canker (DFC), caused by the pathogenic fungus Neoscytalidium dimidiatum, is a severe disease that threatens dragon fruit production worldwide. Current management efforts largely rely on fungicide applications and sanitation measures; however, the pathogen's molecular genetic characterization, nutrient utilization preferences, and extracellular enzyme activities remain poorly understood. Using calcofluor white-based fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that nutrient limitation significantly restricts the growth and maturation of N. dimidiatum, impairing melanization and sporulation. Carbon utilization assays revealed a preference for maltose, suggesting reliance on starch-derived sugars. In addition, nitrogen utilization assays indicated efficient assimilation of complex organic nitrogen sources rich in peptides and amino acids. Finally, we experimentally validated extracellular enzymatic activities involved in host macromolecule degradation, including cellulase, amylase, pectinase, and protease activities. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the physiology and pathogenic potential of N. dimidiatum and establish a foundation for developing improved strategies to mitigate DFC."

    "content": "Intra-strain variation in model bacterial pathogens can compromise experimental reproducibility and obscure biological interpretations. Dickeya solani, a necrotrophic potato pathogen, is widely studied using the type strain IPO 2222. However, phenotypic discrepancies among laboratories led us to investigate the genetic integrity of this reference stock. We identified at least three distinct IPO 2222 variants co-existing in the original stock, differing solely by mutations in the gene encoding the small regulatory RNA (sRNA) ArcZ. These findings resolve conflicting reports of antimicrobial activity in this strain described by Brual et al. (PLOS Genetics 19, e1010725, 2023) and Matilla et al. (mBio, e02472-22, 2022). We demonstrate that these are adaptive mutations rapidly selected in planta during host infection. Crucially, rather than systematically inactivating the gene, these mutations modulate the cellular levels of processed ArcZ. This modulation can uncouple virulence from antimicrobial activity. These variants behave as social cheaters, exhibiting a frequency-dependent fitness advantage over the cooperative wild-type strain during co-infection. These findings provide evidence that remodeling of a pleiotropic sRNA drives the emergence of bacterial cheaters within a plant host. The speed at which these mutants sweep through the population underscores the intense selective pressure acting on regulatory networks during infection, identifying sRNA modulation as a pivotal mechanism for rapid short-term adaptation."

    "content": "The MtrAB two-component system is a master regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species. MtrA is also required for sporulation under certain growth conditions, which means that on some growth media {triangleup}mtrA mutant colonies do not produce aerial hyphae or spores. These mutants are referred to as (conditionally) bald because they lack the hairy appearance of wild-type colonies. Here we report that S. venezuelae NRRL B-65442 {triangleup}mtrA is bald on R2YE agar but sporulates normally on MYM agar and we demonstrate that this is caused by the presence of 10.2% sucrose in R2YE. Consistent with this, we found that adding 10.2% sucrose to MYM agar also inhibits sporulation of the {triangleup}mtrA mutant. Proteomics combined with DNA binding studies revealed that MtrA directly activates the expression of the key developmental regulator genes bldM and whiI on R2YE but not MYM agar. BldM and WhiI work together to activate genes required for aerial hyphae production and sporulation. Crucially, over-expression of bldM-whiI in the {triangleup}mtrA mutant restored normal sporulation in the presence of 10.2% sucrose. We hypothesised that MtrAB must sense and respond to osmotic stress and consistent with this we found that MtrA directly activates biosynthesis of the compatible solute and osmoprotectant ectoine on growth media containing 10.2% sucrose. We propose a model in which high concentrations of sucrose induce osmotic stress in Streptomyces species and this activates MtrAB. The response regulator MtrA then directly activates expression of the ectABCD operon to switch on ectoine biosynthesis and expression of bldM and whiI to trigger entry into sporulation."

Such metabolic cross-feeding can regulate the species composition of prolific marine plankton and biofilms. Algal-produced glycine betaine (GB) can be catabolized by bacteria using a Cbl-dependent demethylase (MtgBCD). Yet, GB's impact on bacterial Cbl production during cross-feeding, and its control by cobalt scarcity remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Phaeobacter inhibens bacteria boost their Cbl production 25-fold when grown in monocultures with GB compared to glucose. During co-cultivation, P. inhibens satisfied the Cbl requirements of Gephyrocapsa huxleyi algae. Transcriptomic analysis of mono- and co-cultures revealed co-expression of mtgBCD and gbcAB genes encoding Cbl-dependent and -independent GB demethylases, respectively. Distinct growth defects of deletion mutants indicate that P. inhibens switches from Cbl-dependent to -independent GB demethylation under cobalt limitation, involving a Cbl riboswitch. Our findings suggest a positive feedback loop in which algal GB release stimulates the bacterial supply of Cbl. We predict the breakdown of this interaction under naturally occurring cobalt limitation which potentially contributes to the transient nature of algal blooms. Comparative genomics indicate that this mechanism is widespread in Rhodobacterales and other abundant marine Alphaproteobacteria, underscoring its pivotal role in global ocean productivity."

Between 25% and 75% of cells contained at least one MGE, with gut-derived SAGs showing the highest MGE load. While most MGEs exhibited narrow, species-specific host ranges, a subset spanned multiple species or higher taxa. We detected MGE clusters and circular, nearly identical genomes repeatedly associated with hosts across phyla, suggesting both genuinely broad host ranges and recurrent DNA entry events. Some broad-host-range viruses likely represent phage-plasmids capable of conjugative transfer. We also identified microbial species acting as major donors or recipients in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) exchange, and MGEs, including unclassified types, that mediate extensive horizontal transfer of auxiliary functions. Together, these findings illuminate MGE-host associations and underscore that the genetic content of microbial cells is fundamentally linked to their MGEs in nature."

This study examines the floristic composition, phytosociological attributes, successional stage, and phylogenetic diversity of three adjacent forest environments within Cantareira State Park, southeastern Brazil, one of the largest remnants of Atlantic Forest. Across 0.525 ha, we sampled 768 individuals, representing 92 species, 65 genera, and 42 families. Species richness was highest in environments B and C (56 species each) and lowest in A (42 species). Tree ferns (Cyathea phalerata and Dicksonia sellowiana) dominated the waterlogged environment A, while environment B was characterized by early secondary canopy trees and shade-tolerant understory species, and environment C by late secondary species such as Ocotea catharinensis and Micropholis crassipedicellata. Clustering analyses integrating floristic, structural, successional, and phylogenetic data revealed that environment C was consistently distinct, whereas A and B showed partial overlap due to shared edaphic conditions. Successional classification indicated apparent differences among environments, but the presence of mature forest indicators, including well-developed tree ferns and late secondary species, suggests that all three environments represent stable, mature forests shaped by contrasting soil and drainage conditions. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing edaphic climax communities within forest mosaics and caution against relying solely on successional stage classifications in conservation planning. Misinterpretation of structurally simple yet mature forests may bias management decisions and reduce protection under current legislation."

    "content": "Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is a parasitoid fungus that predominantly infects ants from the Camponotini tribe, inducing behavioural changes to enhance its survival and reproduction. The most notable change occurs during the final infection phase, where the infected ant leaves its nest to perform the \"death grip\", hanging upside down and biting onto a substrate to anchor itself. In the tropics, these infected ants congregate at specific locations known as zombie graveyards, which have optimal conditions for spore dispersal. This study examines the spatial dynamics of known graveyards at a national park in Borneo, Malaysia, by assessing existing sites and identifying new ones. We located old graveyards at Night Walk and Paku Trail and discovered a new one at Botany Loop. The density of ant cadavers per quadrat increased slightly, from 1-3 ants/m2 to 2-4 ants/m2. While the graveyard size at Night Walk remained similar, Paku Trail experienced a nearly two-fold reduction, decreasing from 197 m2 to 97 m2. At Night Walk, three ant hosts were identified, with Colobopsis leonardi being the dominant ant host across all graveyards. Without genetic tests, we could not confirm whether the same O. unilateralis infects all ants in the graveyards. Our findings suggest a general site fidelity of zombie graveyards, with hotspot densities varying spatially, potentially influenced by microclimatic changes. Long-term monitoring of graveyard dynamics is essential for understanding natural infections and the effects of environmental conditions on parasitoid-host ecology."

Field collections included both managed and wild colonies of A. mellifera, A. cerana, A. dorsata, A. florea, and A. andreniformis from peninsular Malaysia, as well as two additional cavity-nesting species of Borneo A. koschevnikovi and A. nuluensis. Species identification was performed based on morphological features, nesting ecology, and subsequently validated through sequencing. Samples collected from peninsular Malaysia showed congruence between field/morphological and molecular identification. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees from Borneo exhibited overlapping morphological characteristics leading to misidentification of species. These findings suggest the reliability of carrying out field-based identification of honey bees in peninsular Malaysia but requires molecular validation for Borneo region. The limitations of morphology-based interpretation for Borneo cavity-nesting bees highlights the need for more population-level and speciation studies on these species."

    "content": "Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become the primary framework for assessing the status, distribution, and habitat associations of forest-dependent wildlife under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP). In 2024, the NWFP PAM program continued to operate as a fully integrated, range-wide monitoring network, building on deployments initiated in 2018 and now conducting surveys across approximately 24 million acres of federal land. Using a randomized 2+20% sampling design, more than 4,000 autonomous recording units generated over 2 million hours of acoustic data analyzed with convolutional neural networks, enabling statistically rigorous inference at regional and range-wide scales. This report summarizes 2024 field efforts and analytical advancements in the context of recent peer-reviewed and in-progress studies. Updated analyses confirm persistent, low occupancy of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), with detections concentrated in the Klamath Mountains and southern Cascades, consistent with long-term demographic declines. Range-wide models of barred owl (Strix varia) landscape use continue to show high occupancy across much of the NWFP area, reinforcing competitive displacement as the dominant driver of spotted owl range contraction. The PAM network also advanced monitoring of marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), with 2024 results supporting PAM as a cost-efficient alternative to traditional audio-visual surveys for assessing inland nesting habitat use in coastal forests. Beyond focal species, the program increasingly supports multi-taxa biodiversity monitoring through bioacoustic bycatch and soundscape analyses, linking species occurrence, habitat condition, and disturbance dynamics. Collectively, 2024 results demonstrate that PAM has reached operational maturity as the cornerstone of Phase II NWFP effectiveness monitoring. Sustaining adequate sampling effort and field capacity remains a challenge but essential, as reduced deployment intensity would increase uncertainty and weaken inference. Continued investment in PAM infrastructure and expertise is critical for informing adaptive management, supporting sustainable timber harvest, and evaluating ecosystem resilience under changing disturbance regimes."

    "content": "Predicting the assembly and stability of microbial ecosystems is fundamentally challenged by the stochasticity inherent in historical contingencies. Although these dynamics often appear reproducible at coarse taxonomic or functional scales, the mechanisms governing fine-grained species-level variation and the emergence of alternative stable states remain an unresolved problem in ecology. Bridging the gap between individual species variability and the emergence of predictable community-level attractors is essential for a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem resilience. Here, by analyzing replicate microbial communities assembled in vitro, we demonstrate that community structure is built upon individual species exhibiting robustly bimodal abundance distributions. Each taxon exists in either a high- or low-abundance state. We show that the collective configuration of these binary species states - a phenomenon also observed in natural systems - drives the correlation structure between community members and defines a set of discrete, alternative community-level attractors. By examining the prevalence of species across these attractors, we uncover a striking taxonomic signal: phylogenetically close relatives are significantly more likely to display reciprocal prevalence patterns - where the dominance of one relative necessitates the suppression of the other - than expected by chance. This discovery directly rejects models based on simple functional redundancy. Instead, it proves that state-dependent competitive exclusion is a primary driver of community divergence, where the identity of the ``winner'' is contingent on the collective state of the entire community. Our work reframes microbial community structure through the lens of discrete population states, providing a predictive framework for understanding ecosystem stability and the engineering of community functions."

We grew fifteen woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) genotypes from a European latitudinal gradient in four common gardens for two years, quantifying primary metabolites and biomass, reproduction and herbivore damage-related traits. Considering all measured traits combined, environment explained the largest variance (30%), followed by genotype-by-environment interactions (18%) and genotype effects (9%), indicating substantial heritable plasticity. However, plasticity was not uniform: northern genotypes showed greater plasticity in stress metabolites like succinic acid but more canalized growth traits, whereas southern genotypes maintained constitutively high protective metabolite levels. Latitude explained 4.4% of plasticity profile variation. Phenotypic variation was consistently better explained by long-term temperature than precipitation at the site of origin across all trait groups under study. Our results indicate that plasticity itself is an evolved, trait-specific characteristic shaped by climatic gradients, challenging simple hierarchies of trait lability."

We investigated the molecular mechanisms at the basis of this aberrant behaviour in European earwigs (Forficula auricularia) infected with the nematode Mermis nigrescens. We performed comparative RNA-seq analysis at different stages of infection and behaviour manipulation in both the host and the parasite. We detected a total of 12,876 and 9,722 expressed genes in the earwig and nematode, respectively. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis showed 673 genes upregulated and 593 downregulated in earwigs, and 2,672 genes upregulated and 2,293 downregulated in nematodes across all comparisons between stages of infection and parasite sizes. Clustering analysis produced six and four clusters of differentially expressed genes in earwigs and nematodes, respectively, based on temporal patterns of expression across stages of infection. With overrepresented analysis using gene ontology terms, we found that the earwig shows increased signalling and sensory pathways, while the nematode ramps up transport and secretory genes during manipulation. We found shared GATA transcription factor motif enriched in the differentially over expressed genes during manipulation in both host and the parasite. Our study provides valuable insights into candidate pathways and genes in the host and the parasite, improving our understanding of the molecular regulation of water-seeking behaviour."

From this data set, we selected 107 congeneric pairs and fit a logistic curve to the abundance ratio versus elevation data to estimate the width of transition zone over which the species ratio changes from 90% to 10%. We found that the distribution of the transition widths range from < 50 m (about a quarter of the pairs) to more than 500 m. This lack of physical exclusion suggests that there is considerable niche separation between closely related species. For a smaller subset of species pairs with better quality data and model fit we investigated the correlation between the degree of range overlap (transition width) on the one hand, and phylogenetic distance and morphological trait difference on the other. We found a significant correlation with mass, beak width and wing size, but not with tarsus length, beak length and phylogenetic distance. This suggests that mass beak width and wing size may play an important role in niche differentiation in the area."

Shavit and Ellison (2021) crystallized this distinction with the phrase \"a zoo is diverse, whereas an ecosystem is heterogeneous\": while diversity quantifies discrete objects (e.g., species), heterogeneity captures the interactions among them as well as with their environments. Analyzing heterogeneity is a foundational challenge across the natural and social sciences, from ecology and medicine to economics. Yet, whereas diversity metrics are well established, a coherent framework for quantifying heterogeneity remains lacking. Inspired by the modular design of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model--the architectural basis of today's Internet--we propose a Three-Layer Heterogeneity Analysis (3-LHA) methodology. Its layers include: (i) a definitions/metrics layer, specifying node- and network-level heterogeneity measures along with scaling metrics; (ii) a statistical tests layer, incorporating bootstrapping to partition heterogeneous and random clusters, and permutation tests for node- and network-level heterogeneity comparisons; and (iii) an applications layer, supporting tasks such as identifying keystone species via rich and heterogeneous clubs, detecting biomarkers, and analyzing heterogeneity-stability relationships. We demonstrate 3-LHA using the global Earth Microbiome Project dataset. The framework inherits the core strengths of its inspiration--modularity, scalability, and cross-domain interoperability--forming a generalizable analytical stack. Although illustrated here with ecological data, 3-LHA is readily applicable to central heterogeneity problems in other fields, such as profiling tumor ecosystems in oncology or modeling household behavior in economics, offering a unified and scalable approach to a pervasive scientific challenge."

    "content": "Understanding the species-habitat relationships of forest specialists is an essential challenge in their effective conservation. However, studies on habitat selection often neglect potential context dependence, even though species performance may differ between natural and managed stands or between forests composed of different tree species. The western barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus, a specialized moth predator and an old-growth forest indicator, is known to rely on fine-scale habitat structures and forest complexity, yet the relative importance of habitat traits across different forest types remains poorly understood. We surveyed the species on 150 plots distributed across five the best-preserved temperate forest types in Poland: spruce, beech, beech-fir, oak-lime-hornbeam and willow-poplar forests. Bat presence was quantified using passive acoustic monitoring, and habitat characteristics were derived from LiDAR, stand inventories and surveys of tree-related microhabitats. We identified canopy gaps, tree height complexity, living tree density and density of trees with insect galleries or cankers, as the best predictors of the species presence, although the strength of these relationships varied among forest types. In single-species stands, the occurrence of the western barbastelle was associated with abundance of canopy gap and complexity of tree heights, whereas in forests with more diverse tree species composition, the relationships with the stand structure were less evident and were replaced by stronger association with fine-scale habitat components such as tree-related microhabitats. Our study demonstrates that the effective conservation of forest specialists requires habitat-specific strategies, because no single habitat variable predicts species occurrence across contrasting forest conditions. For the western barbastelle, conservation actions should involve maintaining small canopy gaps and reduced tree height complexity in single-species stands, while preserving high heterogeneity, i.e. diverse age and size tree classes and high tree species richness in mixed forests. For a large group of forest specialist, strategies tailored to forest type, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, should be considered"

    "content": "Ambrosia beetles rely on vertically transmitted fungal cultivars for nutrition, yet empirical studies reveal a persistent paradox: early galleries often host multiple fungal associates, whereas mature systems exhibit strict one-beetle-one-fungus specificity. The mechanisms driving this transition remain unresolved. Here we develop an integrative eco-evolutionary framework combining deterministic competition (Lotka-Volterra dynamics), stochastic drift, and severe mycangial transmission bottlenecks to quantify the stability and turnover of fungal symbionts. Across >50,000 simulation replicates, we show that multi-fungal coexistence is inherently transient under biologically realistic conditions. Even minimal competitive asymmetries (<5%) yield deterministic exclusion; repeated bottlenecks amplify drift and accelerate diversity loss; and weak but persistent selection ensures long-term fixation of the superior symbiont over hundreds of generations. Replacement by novel fungi follows a strict invasion threshold (s > 1/(2N)), consistent with classical fixation theory and matching empirical patterns of historical symbiont turnover. Multispecies communities collapse even more rapidly, persisting only over short ecological timescales. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the pervasive one-fungus specificity observed across ambrosia beetles. By unifying ecological competition, demographic stochasticity, and evolutionary stability theory, this work offers a general framework for understanding partner fidelity, symbiont filtering, and lineage turnover in insect-microbe mutualisms."

Here, we investigate how fluctuations in resource supply ratios drive the evolution of metabolic strategies. By simulating microbial community assembly in environments with variable resource ratios, we show that diverse metabolic strategies emerge as evolutionary optima in different fluctuation regimes. We find that environments with balanced resource supply select for specialists, whereas imbalanced environments select for generalists. As the magnitude of fluctuations in resource supply ratios progressively increases, generalist strategies smoothly shift from those of hierarchical utilizers to co-utilizers. We identify the duration of temporal niches as the mechanistic driver that selects for reduced lag times over maximal growth rates. These findings demonstrate how the temporal structure of resource availability can spontaneously generate the three distinct metabolic strategies observed in nature."

    "content": "Assisted and passive natural restoration are widely applied strategies for forest restoration, yet their focus on tree recovery makes their effectiveness in restoring broader biodiversity unclear. Assuming that tree recruitment will rebuild whole ecosystems overlooks other taxa and their interactions, and thus underestimates key components of biodiversity like biotic interactions. To address this gap, we assessed how frugivory varied across a restored landscape by assessing how assisted and natural regeneration, together with biotic (fruit size and availability), abiotic (elevation and time), and landscape factors (forest cover and fragmentation) shape frugivore interactions with dummy fruits. We observed that fruit attacks were not driven solely by restoration type but also by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. Attack rates were higher at greater elevations and in areas with increased old-growth and secondary forest cover. Fruit size also influenced attack rates, particularly in restoration areas, where larger fruits experienced more attacks. Because secondary forest results from both restoration strategies, its spread appears to have helped frugivory recovery and maintenance across the landscape. Yet small, isolated old-growth patches remain crucial as reservoirs of frugivore activity. Our findings indicate that forest recovery efforts should look beyond restoration strategies and explicitly consider how biotic traits, abiotic gradients and landscape structure interact to reestablish frugivory and, by extension, broader ecosystem processes."
