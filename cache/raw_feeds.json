One limiting factor for microbial growth on cheese surfaces is iron availability. To better understand the role of iron acquisition in cheese microbial ecology, we investigated the diversity and distribution of iron uptake systems across a wide range of cheeses. We analysed 136 metagenomes and 1400 genomes and Metagenome\u2010Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from 44 French Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses. Using an updated set of Hidden Markov Models targeting iron acquisition genes, we identified a wide diversity of iron uptake systems. Siderophore biosynthesis and import systems were more prevalent in surface\u2010associated species than in those from the cheese core. About 20 different siderophore biosynthesis pathways were detected, with desferrioxamine and enterobactin\u2010type being the most prevalent. Genomic analyses revealed the main bacterial and fungal producers, including Glutamicibacter, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Penicillium. While siderophore biosynthesis pathways were found in a minority of MAGs, iron/siderophore import systems were widespread, suggesting the potential for cross\u2010feeding interactions involving siderophores. These findings enhance our understanding of microbial interactions in cheese and open perspectives for improving ripening cultures by considering iron acquisition traits."

    "content": "Abstract\nWave frictional dissipation is a key process in rough seabed\u2019s environments such as coral reefs, expected to significantly reduce incoming wave energy. In phase\u2010averaged models, wave dissipation is typically estimated through a wave friction factor fw ${f}_{w}$ which is dependent of the near\u2010bed orbital excursion and the hydraulic length, a proxy for the seabed substrate roughness. A field experiment was conducted in the South\u2010Western coral reef barrier of Mayotte (Indian Ocean) to compute fw ${f}_{w}$ through a frequency\u2010integrated wave energy balance. Significant time and space variations of fw ${f}_{w}$ have been observed, driven by the evolution of the wavefield and the diversity of coral geometry and scales found along the barrier. The fine reef architecture has been examined thanks to a high\u2010resolution multi\u2010beam echo sounder survey. This study has reassessed the established link between hydraulic roughness length ks ${k}_{s}$ and roughness standard deviation; it also indicates that second\u2010order roughness metrics may also significantly explain variations in ks ${k}_{s}$. Future challenges remain in the proper definition of the length scales of seabed variability attributed to roughness and to bathymetry."

By modelling resource consumption and species interactions, we show that density\u2010dependent mortality expands coexistence zones and explains variable productivity\u2013diversity relationships.

Negative density dependence is often utilised in complex ecosystem models, typically as a density\u2010dependent mortality term for a population, but its full impact on community structure remains unclear. Here we use mechanistic population models of resource consumption to examine the effects of negative density dependence and develop a tractable framework for understanding diversity patterns in complex systems. To provide mechanistic grounding, we quantify how density\u2010dependent mortality expands coexistence zones along resource gradients in simple communities using graphical analysis. We then derive an analytical formula relating species abundances and coexistence patterns to trait differences among subsets (guilds) of complex communities, in which many species share a resource or predator. Finally, we explain how distinct relationships between productivity and diversity emerge from the resulting mechanistic framework, providing insights into previously unreconciled observed patterns."

    "content": "This study shows that when two spider mite species evolve separately on tomato plants hyperaccumulating cadmium\u2014a stressful environment\u2014their adaptation leads to reduced competition between them and increased intraspecific competition. As a result, instead of one species excluding the other, both can coexist. This demonstrates that evolution in response to abiotic stress can unexpectedly promote species coexistence and influence community diversity, even when species evolve in isolation.\n\nABSTRACT\nAdaptation to abiotic stresses generally relies on traits that are not independent from those affecting species interactions. Still, the impact of such evolutionary processes on coexistence remains elusive. Here, we studied two spider mite species evolving separately on tomato plants that hyper\u2010accumulated cadmium, a stressful environment for herbivores, or on plants without cadmium. Through experimental evolution and structural stability theory, we found that both species coexist in the cadmium environment, but the evolution of a single species in cadmium leads to exclusion. However, when both species evolve in cadmium they can coexist. This shift occurred due to a simultaneous increase in intra and a decrease in interspecific competition in that environment. These predictions were further confirmed with complementary experiments of population dynamics. Therefore, population shifts to novel environments, even in the absence of interspecific competitors, may have unforeseen evolutionary consequences for community composition and the maintenance of species diversity."

    "content": "<p>by Marika Constant, Elisa Filevich, Pascal Mamassian</p>\n\nAccording to the Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. While it is generally assumed that priors influence both decisions and confidence in the same way, previous work has found priors to have a stronger impact at the confidence level, challenging this assumption. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants\u2019 confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed tilted moving-line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions \u2013 one in which the prior impacted discrimination performance, and one in which it did not. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced discrimination decisions, even after accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to be best explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This is in agreement with a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a greater influence on the metacognitive level than on perceptual decisions."

    "content": "<p>by Nishant Joshi, Sven van Der Burg, Tansu Celikel, Fleur Zeldenrust</p>\n\nNeuronal classification based on morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular markers is often considered static. Here, we challenge this view, showing that functional classification depends on input patterns. Using single-cell recordings from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons in mice, we compared responses to step-and-hold versus dynamic frozen noise inputs that mimic presynaptic activity. Action potential and waveform-based classifications varied significantly, highlighting the dynamic nature of neuronal identity. To assess the contribution of input versus neuronal attributes toward classification, we analyzed four attribute sets, namely action potential, passive biophysical, adaptation currents, and linear input filters derived via spike-triggered averages (STA). Our findings revealed that the STA, which captures a neuron\u2019s selective responsiveness to presynaptic activity, explained the most variance within the population. This highlights input-driven dynamics as key to functional identity, emphasizing the need for physiologically relevant inputs in defining neuronal classes and shifting the focus from static properties to dynamic functional diversity."

    "content": "<p>by Romain Enjalbert, Jakub K\u00f6ry, Timm Kr\u00fcger, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>\n\nThe tumour microvasculature is abnormal, and as a consequence oxygen and drug transport to the tumour tissue is impaired. The abnormal microvasculature contributes to tumour tissue hypoxia, as well as to varying drug penetration depth in the tumour. Many anti-cancer treatments require the presence of oxygen to be fully efficacious, however the question of how well oxygen concentration overlaps with drug concentration is not elucidated, which could compromise the therapeutic effect of these drugs. In this work we use a computational model of blood flow and oxygen transport, and develop a model for an oxygen-dependent drug, T-DM1, to study the overlap of oxygen and drug concentration in tumour tissue, where we model both compressed and uncompressed vessels in the tumour. Our results show that, due to the compressed vessels present in tumours, areas of sufficient oxygen concentration for a drug to function overlap poorly with areas of sufficient drug concentration, covering 28% of the tumour tissue, compared to 82% in healthy tissue. The reduction in drug and oxygen overlap is due to the altered red blood cell dynamics through the abnormal microvasculature, and indicates that drug transport to tumours should not be considered independently of oxygen transport in cases where the drug requires oxygen to function."

    "content": "Remarkably, human brains have the ability to accurately perceive and process the real-world size of objects, despite vast differences in distance and perspective. While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties \u2013 such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size \u2013 are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models."

    "content": "In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals for supervised learning at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. It has not been tested so far whether CF signaling may also influence plasticity in other brain areas. Here, we show that optogenetic CF activation suppresses potentiation of whisker responses in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex of awake mice that is observed after repeated whisker stimulation. Using two-photon imaging and chemogenetics, we find that CFs control plasticity by modulating SST- and VIP-positive interneurons in S1 cortex. Transsynaptic labeling identifies zona incerta (ZI) to thalamic posterior medial nucleus projections as a pathway for cerebellar output reaching S1 cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of PV-positive neurons in the ZI prevents CF co-activation effects, identifying the ZI as a critical relay. Our findings demonstrate that CFs impact sensory signal processing and plasticity in S1 cortex and thus may convey instructive signals."

    "content": "Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and two-photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha retinal ganglion cells (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (types 5i, 6, and 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways."

    "content": "Neural lamination is a common feature of the CNS, with several subcellular structures, such as adherens junctions (AJs), playing a role in this process. The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli."

Using seasonal forecasts, this study investigates the modulation of the North Atlantic response to SSWs by El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Forecast systems reproduce the tropospheric variability following SSWs found in reanalysis, including an increase of events followed by a poleward\u2010positioned jet during La Ni\u00f1a winters.

Regionally, emissions were underestimated in northern Africa (\u223c0.25\u00a0PgC\u00a0yr\u22121) due to missing burned area and overestimated in southern Africa (\u223c0.05\u00a0PgC\u00a0yr\u22121) due to inflated fuel assumptions. The inversion reduces inter\u2010inventory discrepancies by 88% and reveals pronounced landscape\u2010dependent biases. These findings highlight the potential of XCO2\u2010based joint inversions to enhance regional emission estimates and improve representations of fire\u2013carbon\u2013climate feedbacks in Earth system models."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study, using the peak electron density of Ionospheric F\u2010region from the Global\u2010scale Observations of the Limb and Disk reports, for the first time, a unique phenomenon: the rapid reversal of the intensity of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) crests between the hemispheres during the main phase of 23 April 2023, geomagnetic storm. The Prompt Penetration Electric Field amplified the intensity of both EIA crests. However, the enhancement at the southern crest began to decay within an hour, while the northern crest began to strengthen. Thermosphere\u2010Ionosphere\u2010Electrodynamics General Circulation Model simulations indicate that trans\u2010equatorial wind played a key role in these variations. Wavelet periodograms of ground\u2010based Total Electron Content measurements confirmed the presence of Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs). Storm\u2010induced winds and TIDs likely changed the altitude of the F\u2010peaks and the recombination rates between crests, and plasma transport by trans\u2010equatorial winds also contributed to this rare phenomenon."

    "content": "Abstract\nGroundwater from the Leizhou Peninsula in tropical South China provides one of the first noble\u2010gas based paleoclimate reconstructions from the East Asian monsoon region. Radiocarbon dating establishes a robust chronology spanning the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Noble gas temperatures reveal a minimum glacial\u2010to\u2010Holocene warming of \u223c5\u00b0C\u20136\u00b0C, consistent with global low\u2010latitude groundwater records. Stable isotopes (\u03b418O) covary with excess air, indicating that they primarily reflect monsoon\u2010driven precipitation changes rather than temperature. These records point to suppressed recharge during the Last Glacial Maximum, a short\u2010lived weakening of the summer monsoon during the Younger Dryas, and intensified precipitation in the early Holocene. By jointly resolving temperature and precipitation signals, fossil groundwater offers a dual constraint on tropical paleoclimate that complements existing continental records and provides benchmarks for testing climate model sensitivity in East Asia."

    "content": "Metabolite-protein interactions (MPIs) are essential for coordinating cellular metabolism and signaling. Yet, MPIs remain incompletely characterized due to the limited scalability of experimental methods and the complexity of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms. Existing computational approaches often focus on direct interactions and overlook higher order associations and effect of drug perturbations. Here we introduce TopoMPI, a graph-based framework that integrates five types of biological relationships, namely, metabolite-metabolite (MMI), protein-protein (PPI), metabolite-protein (MPI), drug-protein (DPI), and drug-drug (DDI), into a heterogeneous network structure. It comprises three complementary sub-models targeting direct interaction prediction, high-order association discovery, and drug-protein-metabolite triplet interaction inference. Comprehensive evaluation across 24 tissue-specific MPI networks, protein-metabolite association studies, and pharmacological metabolomic datasets confirms the biological relevance, robustness, and generalizability of TopoMPI for MPI prediction with AUCs ranging from 0.79 to 0.86. TopoMPI provides a scalable framework for systems-level characterization of metabolic regulation and drug mode of action."

    "content": "Proteins are composed of combinations of 20 amino acids, and the sequences selected through evolution reflect a balance between harmful and beneficial properties that together define their compatibility. However, the general principles governing the compatibility of amino acid sequences in living cells remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated the neutrality--a measure of harmful versus beneficial properties--of simple amino acid homorepeats composed of ten identical residues (Poly10X), using yeast as an experimental model system. EGFP-Poly10X fusions were analyzed using the genetic tug-of-war (gTOW) method to quantify maximum expression levels, revealing amino-acid-specific neutrality values. Hydrophobic repeats (I, V, W, F, Y) were strongly harmful and aggregation-prone, whereas hydrophilic repeats (E, S, N, Q) alleviated harmfulness. These trends were conserved across protein backgrounds and structural contexts. Consistently, hydrophobic repeats such as Poly10I formed aggregates and were intrinsically harmful, whereas Poly10E suppressed protein aggregation and prevented activation of proteotoxic stress responses. Furthermore, analysis of PolyX occurrence across the proteomes of multiple species revealed a strong correlation between experimentally measured Poly10X neutrality and both the length and frequency of homorepeats in natural proteins. Hydrophobic amino acids were rarely observed as homorepeats, whereas residues such as E, N, Q, and S appeared frequently and were beneficial in our assays. Taken together, Poly10X neutrality serves as an experimental measure of amino acid tolerance in cells and defines the compatible sequence space of proteins. It explains the absence of certain homorepeats in nature and has implications for protein design and mutation-induced harmfulness."

    "content": "Loneliness and social isolation strongly associate with increased incidence of diabetes in humans. However, it remains unclear if lack of meaningful social interactions represents a cause or a symptom of disease. In rodents, social isolation leads to metabolic dysregulation, however the dynamics and contributing factors remain poorly understood. Here we show that single-housing young adult male mice for at least three weeks led to fasting hyperglycemia, an effect that was maintained for the duration of single-housing, but was corrected within a week of reverting mice to co-housing conditions. Single-housing did not affect glucose regulation in females. Gonadectomy experiments revealed that testicular factors induced susceptibility to social isolation, as orchiectomy prevented isolation-induced fasting hyperglycemia in males. We did not find a protective role for ovarian hormones, as ovariectomized females were as resilient as intact females to isolation-induced fasting hyperglycemia. To understand the underlying mechanisms for susceptibility to isolation, we measured plasma levels of glucoregulatory hormones. Isolation did not affect the levels of insulin, epinephrine, and corticosterone. However, glucagon levels were distinctly modulated by social isolation in intact and orchiectomized mice. Social isolation induces increased immediate early gene expression in specific neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus, a glucoregulatory brain structure that promotes glucagon release. Taken together, our findings show that testicular hormones make males susceptible to isolation-induced disruption of glucose regulation and suggest that brain glucoregulatory neurons play a role."

    "content": "Burning fossil fuels drives climate change with detrimental consequences on humankind while waste accumulation from increasing consumption threatens biosustainability globally. Gas fermentation enables to recycle carbon oxides (CO and CO2) from industrial waste gases and gasified waste into value-added products using gas-fermenting microbes, namely acetogens. However, our limited understanding of gene function and metabolic regulation is hindering rational engineering of acetogen cell factories. In this work, we identified, for the first time in acetogens, genome-wide protein-RNA interactions contributing to autotrophy in the model-acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum by combining steady-state chemostat cultivation, functional genomics, and computational methods. We first detected limited and uncoupled transcriptional and translational regulation between autotrophy and heterotrophy. Rigorous mapping of genome-wide transcriptional architecture revealed both differential usage and signal strength of transcriptional start and termination sites between genes and growth substrates. We then used computational tools to reconstruct protein-RNA interactions for differentially regulated genes predicting 14 trans-acting regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in post-transcriptional regulation and contributing to autotrophy. Most RBPs, two of which are translationally regulated, perform RNA modifications and regulate mRNA stability while others target translation-related genes. Our work provides valuable knowledge for metabolic engineering of acetogens and potentially contributes towards understanding primordial life on Earth."

    "content": "This study investigates the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to model antimicrobial re-sistance (AMR) dynamics driven by copper exposure. In a simulated environment, three agent strategies were evaluated: (1) random, (2) rule-based, and (3) Q-learning. These agents were compared to assess how varying levels of adaptability affect bacterial re-sistance to chloramphenicol and polymyxin B. The Q-learning agent consistently achieved lower resistance levels and copper burden compared to both the rule-based and random agents, demonstrating its potential for optimizing AMR management. The rule-based agent showed intermediate performance, while the random agent exhibited higher variability in resistance trajectories. This study introduces an exploratory RL framework for simulating AMR control strategies, especially in scenarios where tradition-al diagnostic tools are unavailable. The results demonstrate that RL can provide valuable insights into optimizing AMR management, particularly in settings with limited access to traditional diagnostic tools and resources."

    "content": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen, with chronic infections often associated with biofilm formation. Here, we investigate the previously uncharacterized gene PA3049, which is upregulated under biofilm conditions, to determine its role in infection, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial tolerance. We show that the small uncharacterised protein PA3049, renamed as Biofilm antibiotic tolerance Regulator (BatR), promotes biofilm establishment and enhances bacterial survival in sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Proteomic analysis revealed that BatR influences the R2/F2 pyocin cluster, which drives explosive cell lysis and extracellular DNA (eDNA) release during biofilm development. We further identify a specific interaction between BatR and PA0486 (SrkA), an uncharacterised Ser/Thr protein kinase. We show that SrkA controls biofilm and pyocyanin production, and lysis-mediated eDNA release through regulation of the R2/F2 pyocin cluster and activation of bacteriophage Pf1. Our findings support a model in which SrkA directly regulates key biofilm-associated phenotypes, while BatR acts as a modulatory partner that tunes SrkA activity under specific conditions. Finally, BatR function was tested in high validity infection models, including the ex vivo pig lung model of cystic fibrosis infection and a synthetic chronic-wound model. In these models, BatR contributes to biofilm architecture and antibiotic tolerance, and modulates pyocyanin production. Our study implicates the BatR/SrkA system in the response of P. aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic challenge in lung infections."

    "content": "Microbial interactions shape the composition and stability of the human gut microbiome. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically profiled 1,224 pairwise growth interactions among 36 representative gut bacterial strains using a spent medium assay. Most interactions were inhibitory and largely explained by resource depletion or medium acidification. We investigated further the molecular basis of a positive interaction, showing that Clostridium perfringens promotes the growth of Mediterraneibacter gnavus through extracellular vesicles. Additionally, we identified Veillonella parvula as a key species capable of modulating environmental pH, thereby enabling the growth of Parabacteroides merdae, a strain highly sensitive to acidic conditions. This pH-buffering effect was enhanced by guanine supplementation and persisted in multi-species communities containing different pH-lowering strains from diverse bacterial phyla. This demonstrates the ecological relevance of V. parvula, a species that, despite being commonly present in human gut microbiomes, is generally found at low levels. Overall, the comprehensive dataset and mechanistic insights presented here provide a foundation for rational strategies to manipulate microbiome composition and function."

    "content": "Dragon fruit canker (DFC), caused by the pathogenic fungus Neoscytalidium dimidiatum, is a severe disease that threatens dragon fruit production worldwide. Current management efforts largely rely on fungicide applications and sanitation measures; however, the pathogen's molecular genetic characterization, nutrient utilization preferences, and extracellular enzyme activities remain poorly understood. Using calcofluor white-based fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that nutrient limitation significantly restricts the growth and maturation of N. dimidiatum, impairing melanization and sporulation. Carbon utilization assays revealed a preference for maltose, suggesting reliance on starch-derived sugars. In addition, nitrogen utilization assays indicated efficient assimilation of complex organic nitrogen sources rich in peptides and amino acids. Finally, we experimentally validated extracellular enzymatic activities involved in host macromolecule degradation, including cellulase, amylase, pectinase, and protease activities. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the physiology and pathogenic potential of N. dimidiatum and establish a foundation for developing improved strategies to mitigate DFC."

    "content": "Intra-strain variation in model bacterial pathogens can compromise experimental reproducibility and obscure biological interpretations. Dickeya solani, a necrotrophic potato pathogen, is widely studied using the type strain IPO 2222. However, phenotypic discrepancies among laboratories led us to investigate the genetic integrity of this reference stock. We identified at least three distinct IPO 2222 variants co-existing in the original stock, differing solely by mutations in the gene encoding the small regulatory RNA (sRNA) ArcZ. These findings resolve conflicting reports of antimicrobial activity in this strain described by Brual et al. (PLOS Genetics 19, e1010725, 2023) and Matilla et al. (mBio, e02472-22, 2022). We demonstrate that these are adaptive mutations rapidly selected in planta during host infection. Crucially, rather than systematically inactivating the gene, these mutations modulate the cellular levels of processed ArcZ. This modulation can uncouple virulence from antimicrobial activity. These variants behave as social cheaters, exhibiting a frequency-dependent fitness advantage over the cooperative wild-type strain during co-infection. These findings provide evidence that remodeling of a pleiotropic sRNA drives the emergence of bacterial cheaters within a plant host. The speed at which these mutants sweep through the population underscores the intense selective pressure acting on regulatory networks during infection, identifying sRNA modulation as a pivotal mechanism for rapid short-term adaptation."

    "content": "The MtrAB two-component system is a master regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species. MtrA is also required for sporulation under certain growth conditions, which means that on some growth media {triangleup}mtrA mutant colonies do not produce aerial hyphae or spores. These mutants are referred to as (conditionally) bald because they lack the hairy appearance of wild-type colonies. Here we report that S. venezuelae NRRL B-65442 {triangleup}mtrA is bald on R2YE agar but sporulates normally on MYM agar and we demonstrate that this is caused by the presence of 10.2% sucrose in R2YE. Consistent with this, we found that adding 10.2% sucrose to MYM agar also inhibits sporulation of the {triangleup}mtrA mutant. Proteomics combined with DNA binding studies revealed that MtrA directly activates the expression of the key developmental regulator genes bldM and whiI on R2YE but not MYM agar. BldM and WhiI work together to activate genes required for aerial hyphae production and sporulation. Crucially, over-expression of bldM-whiI in the {triangleup}mtrA mutant restored normal sporulation in the presence of 10.2% sucrose. We hypothesised that MtrAB must sense and respond to osmotic stress and consistent with this we found that MtrA directly activates biosynthesis of the compatible solute and osmoprotectant ectoine on growth media containing 10.2% sucrose. We propose a model in which high concentrations of sucrose induce osmotic stress in Streptomyces species and this activates MtrAB. The response regulator MtrA then directly activates expression of the ectABCD operon to switch on ectoine biosynthesis and expression of bldM and whiI to trigger entry into sporulation."

Such metabolic cross-feeding can regulate the species composition of prolific marine plankton and biofilms. Algal-produced glycine betaine (GB) can be catabolized by bacteria using a Cbl-dependent demethylase (MtgBCD). Yet, GB's impact on bacterial Cbl production during cross-feeding, and its control by cobalt scarcity remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Phaeobacter inhibens bacteria boost their Cbl production 25-fold when grown in monocultures with GB compared to glucose. During co-cultivation, P. inhibens satisfied the Cbl requirements of Gephyrocapsa huxleyi algae. Transcriptomic analysis of mono- and co-cultures revealed co-expression of mtgBCD and gbcAB genes encoding Cbl-dependent and -independent GB demethylases, respectively. Distinct growth defects of deletion mutants indicate that P. inhibens switches from Cbl-dependent to -independent GB demethylation under cobalt limitation, involving a Cbl riboswitch. Our findings suggest a positive feedback loop in which algal GB release stimulates the bacterial supply of Cbl. We predict the breakdown of this interaction under naturally occurring cobalt limitation which potentially contributes to the transient nature of algal blooms. Comparative genomics indicate that this mechanism is widespread in Rhodobacterales and other abundant marine Alphaproteobacteria, underscoring its pivotal role in global ocean productivity."

Between 25% and 75% of cells contained at least one MGE, with gut-derived SAGs showing the highest MGE load. While most MGEs exhibited narrow, species-specific host ranges, a subset spanned multiple species or higher taxa. We detected MGE clusters and circular, nearly identical genomes repeatedly associated with hosts across phyla, suggesting both genuinely broad host ranges and recurrent DNA entry events. Some broad-host-range viruses likely represent phage-plasmids capable of conjugative transfer. We also identified microbial species acting as major donors or recipients in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) exchange, and MGEs, including unclassified types, that mediate extensive horizontal transfer of auxiliary functions. Together, these findings illuminate MGE-host associations and underscore that the genetic content of microbial cells is fundamentally linked to their MGEs in nature."

This study examines the floristic composition, phytosociological attributes, successional stage, and phylogenetic diversity of three adjacent forest environments within Cantareira State Park, southeastern Brazil, one of the largest remnants of Atlantic Forest. Across 0.525 ha, we sampled 768 individuals, representing 92 species, 65 genera, and 42 families. Species richness was highest in environments B and C (56 species each) and lowest in A (42 species). Tree ferns (Cyathea phalerata and Dicksonia sellowiana) dominated the waterlogged environment A, while environment B was characterized by early secondary canopy trees and shade-tolerant understory species, and environment C by late secondary species such as Ocotea catharinensis and Micropholis crassipedicellata. Clustering analyses integrating floristic, structural, successional, and phylogenetic data revealed that environment C was consistently distinct, whereas A and B showed partial overlap due to shared edaphic conditions. Successional classification indicated apparent differences among environments, but the presence of mature forest indicators, including well-developed tree ferns and late secondary species, suggests that all three environments represent stable, mature forests shaped by contrasting soil and drainage conditions. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing edaphic climax communities within forest mosaics and caution against relying solely on successional stage classifications in conservation planning. Misinterpretation of structurally simple yet mature forests may bias management decisions and reduce protection under current legislation."

    "content": "Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is a parasitoid fungus that predominantly infects ants from the Camponotini tribe, inducing behavioural changes to enhance its survival and reproduction. The most notable change occurs during the final infection phase, where the infected ant leaves its nest to perform the \"death grip\", hanging upside down and biting onto a substrate to anchor itself. In the tropics, these infected ants congregate at specific locations known as zombie graveyards, which have optimal conditions for spore dispersal. This study examines the spatial dynamics of known graveyards at a national park in Borneo, Malaysia, by assessing existing sites and identifying new ones. We located old graveyards at Night Walk and Paku Trail and discovered a new one at Botany Loop. The density of ant cadavers per quadrat increased slightly, from 1-3 ants/m2 to 2-4 ants/m2. While the graveyard size at Night Walk remained similar, Paku Trail experienced a nearly two-fold reduction, decreasing from 197 m2 to 97 m2. At Night Walk, three ant hosts were identified, with Colobopsis leonardi being the dominant ant host across all graveyards. Without genetic tests, we could not confirm whether the same O. unilateralis infects all ants in the graveyards. Our findings suggest a general site fidelity of zombie graveyards, with hotspot densities varying spatially, potentially influenced by microclimatic changes. Long-term monitoring of graveyard dynamics is essential for understanding natural infections and the effects of environmental conditions on parasitoid-host ecology."

Field collections included both managed and wild colonies of A. mellifera, A. cerana, A. dorsata, A. florea, and A. andreniformis from peninsular Malaysia, as well as two additional cavity-nesting species of Borneo A. koschevnikovi and A. nuluensis. Species identification was performed based on morphological features, nesting ecology, and subsequently validated through sequencing. Samples collected from peninsular Malaysia showed congruence between field/morphological and molecular identification. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees from Borneo exhibited overlapping morphological characteristics leading to misidentification of species. These findings suggest the reliability of carrying out field-based identification of honey bees in peninsular Malaysia but requires molecular validation for Borneo region. The limitations of morphology-based interpretation for Borneo cavity-nesting bees highlights the need for more population-level and speciation studies on these species."

    "content": "Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become the primary framework for assessing the status, distribution, and habitat associations of forest-dependent wildlife under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP). In 2024, the NWFP PAM program continued to operate as a fully integrated, range-wide monitoring network, building on deployments initiated in 2018 and now conducting surveys across approximately 24 million acres of federal land. Using a randomized 2+20% sampling design, more than 4,000 autonomous recording units generated over 2 million hours of acoustic data analyzed with convolutional neural networks, enabling statistically rigorous inference at regional and range-wide scales. This report summarizes 2024 field efforts and analytical advancements in the context of recent peer-reviewed and in-progress studies. Updated analyses confirm persistent, low occupancy of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), with detections concentrated in the Klamath Mountains and southern Cascades, consistent with long-term demographic declines. Range-wide models of barred owl (Strix varia) landscape use continue to show high occupancy across much of the NWFP area, reinforcing competitive displacement as the dominant driver of spotted owl range contraction. The PAM network also advanced monitoring of marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), with 2024 results supporting PAM as a cost-efficient alternative to traditional audio-visual surveys for assessing inland nesting habitat use in coastal forests. Beyond focal species, the program increasingly supports multi-taxa biodiversity monitoring through bioacoustic bycatch and soundscape analyses, linking species occurrence, habitat condition, and disturbance dynamics. Collectively, 2024 results demonstrate that PAM has reached operational maturity as the cornerstone of Phase II NWFP effectiveness monitoring. Sustaining adequate sampling effort and field capacity remains a challenge but essential, as reduced deployment intensity would increase uncertainty and weaken inference. Continued investment in PAM infrastructure and expertise is critical for informing adaptive management, supporting sustainable timber harvest, and evaluating ecosystem resilience under changing disturbance regimes."

    "content": "Predicting the assembly and stability of microbial ecosystems is fundamentally challenged by the stochasticity inherent in historical contingencies. Although these dynamics often appear reproducible at coarse taxonomic or functional scales, the mechanisms governing fine-grained species-level variation and the emergence of alternative stable states remain an unresolved problem in ecology. Bridging the gap between individual species variability and the emergence of predictable community-level attractors is essential for a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem resilience. Here, by analyzing replicate microbial communities assembled in vitro, we demonstrate that community structure is built upon individual species exhibiting robustly bimodal abundance distributions. Each taxon exists in either a high- or low-abundance state. We show that the collective configuration of these binary species states - a phenomenon also observed in natural systems - drives the correlation structure between community members and defines a set of discrete, alternative community-level attractors. By examining the prevalence of species across these attractors, we uncover a striking taxonomic signal: phylogenetically close relatives are significantly more likely to display reciprocal prevalence patterns - where the dominance of one relative necessitates the suppression of the other - than expected by chance. This discovery directly rejects models based on simple functional redundancy. Instead, it proves that state-dependent competitive exclusion is a primary driver of community divergence, where the identity of the ``winner'' is contingent on the collective state of the entire community. Our work reframes microbial community structure through the lens of discrete population states, providing a predictive framework for understanding ecosystem stability and the engineering of community functions."

We grew fifteen woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) genotypes from a European latitudinal gradient in four common gardens for two years, quantifying primary metabolites and biomass, reproduction and herbivore damage-related traits. Considering all measured traits combined, environment explained the largest variance (30%), followed by genotype-by-environment interactions (18%) and genotype effects (9%), indicating substantial heritable plasticity. However, plasticity was not uniform: northern genotypes showed greater plasticity in stress metabolites like succinic acid but more canalized growth traits, whereas southern genotypes maintained constitutively high protective metabolite levels. Latitude explained 4.4% of plasticity profile variation. Phenotypic variation was consistently better explained by long-term temperature than precipitation at the site of origin across all trait groups under study. Our results indicate that plasticity itself is an evolved, trait-specific characteristic shaped by climatic gradients, challenging simple hierarchies of trait lability."

We investigated the molecular mechanisms at the basis of this aberrant behaviour in European earwigs (Forficula auricularia) infected with the nematode Mermis nigrescens. We performed comparative RNA-seq analysis at different stages of infection and behaviour manipulation in both the host and the parasite. We detected a total of 12,876 and 9,722 expressed genes in the earwig and nematode, respectively. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis showed 673 genes upregulated and 593 downregulated in earwigs, and 2,672 genes upregulated and 2,293 downregulated in nematodes across all comparisons between stages of infection and parasite sizes. Clustering analysis produced six and four clusters of differentially expressed genes in earwigs and nematodes, respectively, based on temporal patterns of expression across stages of infection. With overrepresented analysis using gene ontology terms, we found that the earwig shows increased signalling and sensory pathways, while the nematode ramps up transport and secretory genes during manipulation. We found shared GATA transcription factor motif enriched in the differentially over expressed genes during manipulation in both host and the parasite. Our study provides valuable insights into candidate pathways and genes in the host and the parasite, improving our understanding of the molecular regulation of water-seeking behaviour."

From this data set, we selected 107 congeneric pairs and fit a logistic curve to the abundance ratio versus elevation data to estimate the width of transition zone over which the species ratio changes from 90% to 10%. We found that the distribution of the transition widths range from < 50 m (about a quarter of the pairs) to more than 500 m. This lack of physical exclusion suggests that there is considerable niche separation between closely related species. For a smaller subset of species pairs with better quality data and model fit we investigated the correlation between the degree of range overlap (transition width) on the one hand, and phylogenetic distance and morphological trait difference on the other. We found a significant correlation with mass, beak width and wing size, but not with tarsus length, beak length and phylogenetic distance. This suggests that mass beak width and wing size may play an important role in niche differentiation in the area."

Shavit and Ellison (2021) crystallized this distinction with the phrase \"a zoo is diverse, whereas an ecosystem is heterogeneous\": while diversity quantifies discrete objects (e.g., species), heterogeneity captures the interactions among them as well as with their environments. Analyzing heterogeneity is a foundational challenge across the natural and social sciences, from ecology and medicine to economics. Yet, whereas diversity metrics are well established, a coherent framework for quantifying heterogeneity remains lacking. Inspired by the modular design of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model--the architectural basis of today's Internet--we propose a Three-Layer Heterogeneity Analysis (3-LHA) methodology. Its layers include: (i) a definitions/metrics layer, specifying node- and network-level heterogeneity measures along with scaling metrics; (ii) a statistical tests layer, incorporating bootstrapping to partition heterogeneous and random clusters, and permutation tests for node- and network-level heterogeneity comparisons; and (iii) an applications layer, supporting tasks such as identifying keystone species via rich and heterogeneous clubs, detecting biomarkers, and analyzing heterogeneity-stability relationships. We demonstrate 3-LHA using the global Earth Microbiome Project dataset. The framework inherits the core strengths of its inspiration--modularity, scalability, and cross-domain interoperability--forming a generalizable analytical stack. Although illustrated here with ecological data, 3-LHA is readily applicable to central heterogeneity problems in other fields, such as profiling tumor ecosystems in oncology or modeling household behavior in economics, offering a unified and scalable approach to a pervasive scientific challenge."

    "content": "Understanding the species-habitat relationships of forest specialists is an essential challenge in their effective conservation. However, studies on habitat selection often neglect potential context dependence, even though species performance may differ between natural and managed stands or between forests composed of different tree species. The western barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus, a specialized moth predator and an old-growth forest indicator, is known to rely on fine-scale habitat structures and forest complexity, yet the relative importance of habitat traits across different forest types remains poorly understood. We surveyed the species on 150 plots distributed across five the best-preserved temperate forest types in Poland: spruce, beech, beech-fir, oak-lime-hornbeam and willow-poplar forests. Bat presence was quantified using passive acoustic monitoring, and habitat characteristics were derived from LiDAR, stand inventories and surveys of tree-related microhabitats. We identified canopy gaps, tree height complexity, living tree density and density of trees with insect galleries or cankers, as the best predictors of the species presence, although the strength of these relationships varied among forest types. In single-species stands, the occurrence of the western barbastelle was associated with abundance of canopy gap and complexity of tree heights, whereas in forests with more diverse tree species composition, the relationships with the stand structure were less evident and were replaced by stronger association with fine-scale habitat components such as tree-related microhabitats. Our study demonstrates that the effective conservation of forest specialists requires habitat-specific strategies, because no single habitat variable predicts species occurrence across contrasting forest conditions. For the western barbastelle, conservation actions should involve maintaining small canopy gaps and reduced tree height complexity in single-species stands, while preserving high heterogeneity, i.e. diverse age and size tree classes and high tree species richness in mixed forests. For a large group of forest specialist, strategies tailored to forest type, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, should be considered"

    "content": "Ambrosia beetles rely on vertically transmitted fungal cultivars for nutrition, yet empirical studies reveal a persistent paradox: early galleries often host multiple fungal associates, whereas mature systems exhibit strict one-beetle-one-fungus specificity. The mechanisms driving this transition remain unresolved. Here we develop an integrative eco-evolutionary framework combining deterministic competition (Lotka-Volterra dynamics), stochastic drift, and severe mycangial transmission bottlenecks to quantify the stability and turnover of fungal symbionts. Across >50,000 simulation replicates, we show that multi-fungal coexistence is inherently transient under biologically realistic conditions. Even minimal competitive asymmetries (<5%) yield deterministic exclusion; repeated bottlenecks amplify drift and accelerate diversity loss; and weak but persistent selection ensures long-term fixation of the superior symbiont over hundreds of generations. Replacement by novel fungi follows a strict invasion threshold (s > 1/(2N)), consistent with classical fixation theory and matching empirical patterns of historical symbiont turnover. Multispecies communities collapse even more rapidly, persisting only over short ecological timescales. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the pervasive one-fungus specificity observed across ambrosia beetles. By unifying ecological competition, demographic stochasticity, and evolutionary stability theory, this work offers a general framework for understanding partner fidelity, symbiont filtering, and lineage turnover in insect-microbe mutualisms."

Here, we investigate how fluctuations in resource supply ratios drive the evolution of metabolic strategies. By simulating microbial community assembly in environments with variable resource ratios, we show that diverse metabolic strategies emerge as evolutionary optima in different fluctuation regimes. We find that environments with balanced resource supply select for specialists, whereas imbalanced environments select for generalists. As the magnitude of fluctuations in resource supply ratios progressively increases, generalist strategies smoothly shift from those of hierarchical utilizers to co-utilizers. We identify the duration of temporal niches as the mechanistic driver that selects for reduced lag times over maximal growth rates. These findings demonstrate how the temporal structure of resource availability can spontaneously generate the three distinct metabolic strategies observed in nature."

    "content": "Assisted and passive natural restoration are widely applied strategies for forest restoration, yet their focus on tree recovery makes their effectiveness in restoring broader biodiversity unclear. Assuming that tree recruitment will rebuild whole ecosystems overlooks other taxa and their interactions, and thus underestimates key components of biodiversity like biotic interactions. To address this gap, we assessed how frugivory varied across a restored landscape by assessing how assisted and natural regeneration, together with biotic (fruit size and availability), abiotic (elevation and time), and landscape factors (forest cover and fragmentation) shape frugivore interactions with dummy fruits. We observed that fruit attacks were not driven solely by restoration type but also by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. Attack rates were higher at greater elevations and in areas with increased old-growth and secondary forest cover. Fruit size also influenced attack rates, particularly in restoration areas, where larger fruits experienced more attacks. Because secondary forest results from both restoration strategies, its spread appears to have helped frugivory recovery and maintenance across the landscape. Yet small, isolated old-growth patches remain crucial as reservoirs of frugivore activity. Our findings indicate that forest recovery efforts should look beyond restoration strategies and explicitly consider how biotic traits, abiotic gradients and landscape structure interact to reestablish frugivory and, by extension, broader ecosystem processes."

    "content": "Abstract\nComplex coastal ecosystems require management that addresses interacting stressors affecting ecosystem size and persistence. In natural systems, lateral erosion of salt\u2010marsh edges and mudflats is thought to enhance vertical resilience to sea\u2010level rise (SLR) by augmenting sediment delivery to the marsh platform. Using the Coastal Landscape Transect model, we test how two common restoration practices, shoreline stabilizations and thin\u2010layer placements, affect vertical and lateral resilience of marshes under accelerating SLR. We find that shoreline stabilization provides optimum restoration at low rates of SLR, but in later years, as SLR accelerates and losses from drowning supersede those associated with edge erosion, thin\u2010layer placement imparts a higher degree of marsh resilience. Furthermore, stabilizing the marsh edge eventually facilitates threshold responses to SLR with sudden and extensive narrowing of the marsh due to interior drowning. However, contrary to expectations, results suggest that vertical\u2010lateral couplings fail to meaningfully counteract drowning with a 1\u00a0m\u00a0yr\u22121 increase in edge erosion delaying initiation of interior drowning by <3\u00a0years. Finally, we propose \u201cvolumetric elevation capital\u201d as a metric that allows for the assessment of marsh health across multiple dimensions, thereby avoiding drawbacks otherwise associated with threshold responses to management interventions."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a dominant low\u2010frequency climate mode in the North Pacific, modulates sea surface temperature (SST), circulation dynamics, and wind stress, thereby controlling nutrient supply and phytoplankton primary production (PP) in the sunlit ocean layer. However, the mechanisms linking PDO to PP variability remain insufficiently understood, mainly due to limited long\u2010term observational data sets. Using simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (CESM\u2010LE), which includes both historical and RCP8.5 scenarios (1920\u20132100), this study investigates PDO impacts on PP across the Pacific Ocean. The PP response to the PDO exhibits strong latitudinal variability driven by regional limiting factors. In subarctic regions, PP exhibits a tripolar pattern associated with the PDO and is primarily controlled by nutrient availability, particularly iron and nitrate. In the mid\u2010latitude North Pacific, upper\u2010euphotic PP is positively correlated with PDO, largely regulated by lateral nutrient transport within the mixed layer. In contrast, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) acts as the dominant linkage between PDO and PP in the lower euphotic zone. The PDO's influence also extends to the tropical Pacific, where its positive phases weaken trade winds and equatorial currents, reducing the zonal nitrate supply and leading to significant PP declines in the western and central tropical Pacific. Together, these results illustrate how the PDO orchestrates marine productivity through distinct regional mechanisms."

    "content": "Abstract\nLarge\u2010scale offshore wind farms are expected to influence surface waves by modifying local wind forcing through wake effects. We use regional coupled ocean\u2010atmosphere\u2010wave model simulations to investigate a realistic large\u2010scale offshore wind development scenario in the northeastern U.S. during boreal summer. Near\u2010surface wind speeds are reduced by 10% over lease areas and within downstream wake regions, leading to decreases in significant wave height (3%) and wave\u2010supported momentum flux (30%). This further leads to reductions in surface roughness length (16%) and near\u2010surface ocean turbulent kinetic energy (20%). Spectral analysis shows a clear reduction in wind\u2010sea energy, indicating suppressed local wind\u2010wave growth near the wind farms. Weaker winds favor the development of longer\u2010period waves, increasing dominant wave phase speed by 3% and suggesting a transition to an older sea state. Modern bulk flux algorithms often parameterize surface roughness using inverse wave age and/or wave slope. This raises the question of whether wake\u2010driven reductions in inverse wave age and wave height impact air\u2010sea momentum exchange. To assess this, we compare fully coupled simulations with an atmosphere\u2010only run excluding wave coupling. Results show that about one\u2010third of the reduction in roughness length can be attributed to sea state changes, while two\u2010thirds result from lower friction velocity due to lower wind speeds. However, the impact of sea state on the drag coefficient and momentum flux is negligible (\u223c ${\\sim} $1%), suggesting that wake\u2010induced wind speed reductions are the primary driver, with sea state changes playing a secondary role."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study evaluates the response method for predicting tidal currents. We introduce a coupled response model which explicitly accounts for interactions between velocity components. By leveraging non\u2010parametric and data\u2010driven weight estimation, the approach demonstrates superior predictive accuracy compared to classical harmonic analysis (HA), particularly for fast\u2010moving and non\u2010linear tidal currents. Using ADCP data from the world's largest deployment of tidal stream turbines, the coupled model achieves superior accuracy with fewer than 30\u00a0days of input measurements compared to HA using over 180\u00a0days of data. Accuracy improvements extend to both current predictions and the derived harmonic constituents, obtained through a specialized procedure. The response approach shows greater robustness when applied to extremely sparse data. This is reflected by the pseudo\u2010admittances, which also show the non\u2010parametric approach advanced can effectively capture unsmooth deviations in the admittance. Analysis of 40 active NOAA current stations highlight when the response approach should and should not be used, yielding average reductions in absolute error of 9.6%. The framework offers new opportunities for studying non\u2010tidal forcing and sediment transport and has significant implications for tidal energy site development. The proposed method is implemented in the open\u2010source RTide Python package, providing a practical and accessible tool that reduces the level of expertise required to apply the response method to higher\u2010order nonlinear processes."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nAdvances in sequencing and chromosome\u2010scale assembly have brought non\u2010model animals into focus, deepening our understanding of genome and chromosome evolution. Here, we present the waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) as an emerging model antelope for studying population dynamics and chromosome evolution. Waterbuck evolutionary history has been shaped by both climatic and geographic changes, as well as structural chromosome changes, principally Robertsonian (Rb) fusions. To provide new insights into waterbuck evolution, we generated a chromosome\u2010level genome assembly for the species using PacBio HiFi and Hi\u2010C sequencing. We further leveraged museum collections to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 24 historical specimens. Combined with a previous WGS dataset (n\u2009=\u2009119), this represents the largest study of waterbuck populations to date and reveals previously unrecognised population structure and gene flow between waterbuck populations, alongside several regions of high genomic differentiation between the two recognised subspecies. Notably, several differentiation hotspots occur near the centromeres of fixed and polymorphic Rb fusions, exhibiting signatures of low recombination and local population structure. These regions contain genes involved in development, fertility, and recombination. Our findings underscore the value of chromosome\u2010level genome assemblies, the critical role of historical collections in capturing fine\u2010scale population structure and gene flow in species with wide\u2010ranging distributions, and the potential evolutionary impacts of Rb fusions on genomic differentiation and recombination landscapes."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nCrown\u2010of\u2010thorns sea star (CoTS) outbreaks are a main cause of hard coral cover decline across the Indo\u2010Pacific, posing a major threat to the resilience of coral reefs. However, the drivers underlying CoTS feeding on preferred (e.g., Acropora species) versus non\u2010preferred (e.g., Porites species) are poorly understood. We hypothesised that coral venom may influence CoTS prey preferences. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the coral venom toxin families across the genomes of preferred (A. digitifera, A. hyacinthus, A. millepora and A. tenuis) and non\u2010preferred (P. australiensis, P. compressa, P. lutea and P. rus) prey species of CoTS. We also included one species from each genus inhabiting the Caribbean, where CoTS are absent (A. cervicornis and P. astreoides), to broaden our identification of venom constituents shared within each genus and investigate geographic differences. We collected known cnidarian toxins, and along with the cnidarian Tox\u2010Prot database, used these to identify putative toxins and investigate their phylogeny. The most abundant toxins across all coral species included neurotoxins (kunitz\u2010type and SCRiPS) and pore\u2010forming toxins (actinoporins and MAC\u2010PFs). We found genera\u2010specific differences with jellyfish toxins (CFXs) only present in Porites species. Similarly, only Acropora species harboured pore\u2010forming toxins with the aerolysin domain. Two toxin homologues only present in Indo\u2010Pacific corals (CFX and MAC\u2010PF homologues) showed evidence of positive selection, suggesting their evolution is shaped by environmental pressures, including exposure to CoTS. These findings provide a foundation for future studies of scleractinian venoms, which have direct applications to assessing reef coral's susceptibility to future CoTS outbreaks and active reef management."

Population history, selection and stochastic processes can concur to generate a continuum from distinct to highly parallel evolutionary trajectories across replicate populations. Yet, the role of genetic and environmental factors in shaping this continuum remains underexplored. We quantified repeated genetic adaptation in lizards that colonised multiple islands with comparable environmental gradients, investigating whether environmental\u2010dependent and divergence\u2010dependent processes can explain the degree of repeated adaptation (genetic reuse and trajectory similarity). We found 149 genes exhibiting repeated adaptation in multiple islands, some of which are likely involved in thermal physiology and developmental processes. Genetic reuse was stronger at the functional level than at the mutation level and exceeded random expectations, highlighting that different genetic combinations can generate similar functional outcomes. Adaptive trajectories were more similar between islands with low genetic differentiation and similar environmental conditions, but the effects of genetic and environmental factors varied across the diverse facets of repeatability. Overall, our findings reveal the extent and conditions under which local adaptation is, in part, predictable."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nBiological invasions are major drivers of recent biodiversity changes, yet the genetic structure and ecological mechanisms underlying invasion dynamics remain poorly resolved in invasive social insects. In South Africa, the European wasp Vespula germanica (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), introduced in the 1970s, has spread remarkably more slowly than in other regions and its geographical distribution in the country remains limited. Although two mitochondrial haplotypes have been reported in South Africa, the species' range expansion and fine\u2010scale population structure remain poorly understood. Using 2b\u2010RAD sequencing of 47 colonies across its entire range in South Africa, we identified two main genetic clusters that correspond to previously identified mitochondrial haplotypes, strongly supporting the double introduction scenario. This well\u2010defined genetic structure is sustained by limited gene flow and possibly by niche preferences. Spatial patterns reveal a dispersal system of short\u2010range natural movements and human\u2010mediated jumps, with Stellenbosch acting as a secondary introduction point. Ecological niche preferences appear to maintain a genetic structure through isolation by environment: one group occupies warmer, drier sites, while the other is confined to cooler, wetter microclimates near Cape Town. This pattern reflects ecological adaptation that is likely tied to distinct population origins. As the first genome\u2010wide study of V.\u2009germanica, this work illuminates how introduction history and ecological constraints shape invasion dynamics, laying a foundation for understanding the genetic structure and invasion dynamics of the species and for developing predictive management frameworks."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nColour polytypism represents an example of phenotypic diversification shaped by genetic divergence and ecological pressures. Poison frogs of the genus Oophaga (Dendrobatidae) are highly polytypic in coloration, making them an ideal system for investigating the genetic and physiological basis of colour variation. We examined gene expression, pigment and histological differences across four colour morphs (aquamarine, brown, green, and red) of Oophaga vicentei from mainland Panama. RNA sequencing revealed 1838 and 5085 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin and liver, respectively. Melanin synthesis genes were upregulated in the brown morph, whereas pteridine pathway genes were upregulated in red and green morphs, consistent with previous findings in O. pumilio. In aquamarine frogs, pigment composition was similar to brown and green frogs, but transcriptional profiles were highly divergent. Red morphs upregulate a paralog of the dendrobatid ketolase cyp3a80 in the liver, suggesting modified ketolation mechanisms in O. vicentei. This is consistent with higher ketocarotenoid accumulation in red frogs. Co\u2010expression network analysis identified morph\u2010related modules in both tissues but the relationship between modules and known pigmentation pathways remains unclear. Comparative analysis across seven dendrobatid species revealed conserved pigmentation genes (e.g., xdh, ttc3b) alongside morph\u2010specific expression patterns. Our results show that red frogs are dissimilar in pigments, chromatophore structure, and gene expression, whereas aquamarine, brown, and green coloration share overlapping pigment profiles and chromatophore organisation, with transcriptional differences suggesting structural or regulatory mechanisms."

    "content": "Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function."

Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain."

Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intraretinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased smooth muscle actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization \u2013 loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling \u2013 show that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation."

In this work, we introduce <i>DendroTweaks</i>, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more intuitive and more interactive. <i>DendroTweaks</i> features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, <i>DendroTweaks</i> focuses on subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distribution of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and placement of synaptic inputs. The toolbox supports various experimental protocols designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output, thereby enhancing model validation. It helps users build high-level, modular model representations and includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. Finally, it enables model simplification through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm, allowing users to export models for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. By combining extensive visualization capabilities and comprehensive data management functionality, <i>DendroTweaks</i> introduces a novel interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics. This approach will accelerate research on dendritic computations, their underlying mechanisms, and their fundamental role in brain function."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/105782",
    "content": "Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity, and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a multivariable model comprising morphological, spatial, and clinical information achieved an AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24 hr hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool."

    "content": "Abstract\nBy analyzing velocity changes of the Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS) from October 2014 to August 2025 using Sentinel\u20101A/B imagery, we find that the PIIS flow changed markedly over this period. A distinct slowdown occurred at the central PIIS from 14 March 2022 to 20 January 2023, during which velocities decreased from 13.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 to 12.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0m\u00a0day\u22121 (\u22120.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0m\u00a0day\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121). Piglet Glacier, a major tributary of the PIIS, also experienced two deceleration periods between 2023 and 2025. The transitions from acceleration to deceleration and then to near\u2010steady flow coincided with substantial changes in m\u00e9lange configuration. Our analysis clearly demonstrates that the flow of the central PIIS and Piglet Glacier is highly sensitive to mechanical coupling along their shear margins. Specifically, the recent slowdowns in the ice flow are most easily explained by variations in the state and configuration of dense ice m\u00e9lange."

    "content": "Abstract\nEarth experienced a long\u2010term cooling trend during the middle\u2010late Devonian, culminating in the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA)\u2014the longest icehouse in Earth's history. The onset of glaciation has been attributed to CO2 removal through silicate weathering, however previous carbon cycle models have failed to reproduce its timing. Here, we build a high\u2010resolution climate emulator using the Community Earth System Model and couple it with the SCION Earth Evolution model to better simulate continental weathering. This new framework successfully aligns modeled carbon drawdown and glaciation onset with geological proxy data. We find that additional cooling was driven by increased continental exposure during long\u2010term marine regression associated with Pangea's assembly, which boosted global weatherability and increased albedo. Our results highlight that changes in continental exposure are critical for long\u2010term climate evolution, and that high\u2010resolution climate models are needed to understand these impacts."

Results show that an increase in vertical diffusivity \u03ba associated with tidal mixing can enhance poleward MHT in most of the global ocean by strengthening the overturning circulations in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean (located in the Southern Hemisphere), and weakening it in the Southern Ocean. A mathematical fitting reveals that MHT follows a power\u2010law relationship with \u03ba by a coefficient of about 0.1, that is, MHTpw\u00a0\u221d\u00a0\u03ba0.1.

    "content": "Abstract\nIn late September 2024, Hurricane Helene contributed to catastrophic flooding in the Southeastern United States. The impacts of the hurricane were compounded by a predecessor rain event (PRE) 1\u2010day earlier, inducing unusually high precipitation and soil moisture (SM). In this case study, we examined the predictability of precipitation and SM conditions associated with these events in NOAA's operation Coupled Forecast System model (CFSv2). Specifically, we investigated the predictability of Helene and the PRE as a function forecast lead time (LT). To assess the model's ability to represent both Helene and PRE, as well as the predictability of their resulting precipitation and SM, we applied tracking of both systems with different LTs from 3 to 6\u00a0days. Our results show that the predictability drops around 4\u2010 to 5\u2010day LTs, in association with biases in the timing and location of Helene and PRE, as well as underestimated precipitation associated with the PRE."

    "content": "Abstract\nPolar amplification\u2014the phenomenon whereby anthropogenic warming is accentuated relative to the global average\u2014has emerged as a central focus of climate research. While Arctic amplification is well\u2010established, the presence and drivers of Antarctic amplification remain contentious. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations, we demonstrate a robust emergence of Antarctic amplification under the 2\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. Sensitivity experiments identify a pivotal role for sea surface temperature (SST) changes in mediating this anthropogenic response. Positive SST anomalies influence Antarctic temperature through dynamic and thermodynamic processes, exerting distinct and contrasting effects. Dynamic processes, characterized by intensification of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), generally induce continental\u2010scale cooling. In contrast, thermodynamic processes, specially through enhanced sensible and latent heat fluxes, take precedence over the dynamic effect and drive widespread warming. In a warming climate, these thermodynamic processes are expected to intensify substantially, thereby amplifying the anthropogenic climate signal over Antarctica."

    "content": "Abstract\nAtmospheric aerosols often contain surface\u2010active organics, which reduce surface tension and enhance cloud droplets activation. This effect is often neglected in the application of K\u00f6hler theory where a constant surface tension equivalent to pure water is assumed. Using a cloud parcel model, we evaluated the impact of four representative surface\u2010active organics, humic\u2010like substances (HULIS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cis\u2010pinonic acid, and dicarboxylic acids, on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation under varied atmospheric conditions. Our results indicate that HULIS significantly enhance CCN activation, particularly at high aerosol concentrations, low updraft velocities, and small particle sizes. SDS, cis\u2010pinonic acid, and dicarboxylic acids also increase activation but to a lesser degree. The surface activity of HULIS has a stronger influence on CCN activation than its hygroscopicity, with particle size being the most sensitive parameter. This study emphasizes the need to incorporate surface\u2010active organics into climate models to improve the prediction of aerosol\u2010cloud interactions."

    "content": "Abstract\nContrails are a significant contributor to aviation's climate impact with an effective radiative forcing similar to that from aviation's CO2 ${\\text{CO}}_{2}$ emissions, yet large uncertainties remain. Many observational contrail studies rely on data from a single sensor, in recent years increasingly from a geostationary imager, accepting lower spatial resolution in exchange for higher temporal and spatial coverage. However, the ability of geostationary imagery to resolve contrails has not been systematically characterized. By comparing higher spatial resolution low Earth orbit satellite imagery from Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to geostationary satellite imagery from GOES ABI, we show that the latter does not resolve 80% of the contrails nor half of the total length compared to contrails identified with VIIRS. Our findings underscore the need for multi\u2010sensor approaches to collect observational contrail data for improved validation of climate models and to enable more rigorous and verifiable contrail avoidance strategies."

Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical model of the ISR, calibrated to time-resolved proteomics data that captures how cells encode the magnitude and duration of stress signals to generate a homeostatic output. Our simulations and data converge on an ISR activation threshold defined by phosphorylated eIF2 levels, and sequential cascading delays in the accumulation of the ISR components ATF4, GADD34, CHOP, and DR5, suggesting hardwired molecular timers regulate ISR behaviors. Our combined experimental and computational analyses reveal limiting ATF4 levels, which can be suppressed when TC levels drop below a threshold that would allow its translation. While our model accurately predicts this initial saturation limit, its divergence from the data at high stress levels, correlated with minimal TC levels, identified a \"translational cliff\" that defines a finite ATF4-dependent ISR operational range. This work establishes a quantitative platform to probe ISR dynamics and generate novel, testable hypotheses."

    "content": "Microbial utilization of lignin-derived aromatics requires extensive metabolic flexibility, yet growth outcomes vary sharply with substrate chemistry and oxygen availability. Whether this variability reflects distinct growth programs or alternative realizations of shared biochemical constraints remains unclear. Here, we combine quantitative proteomics with cross-condition machine learning to test whether growth-rate variation in Rhodopseudomonas palustris can be predicted directly from proteome composition and to identify the proteomic features that consistently encode growth potential across environments. Using OmniProt, a cross-condition neural modeling and interpretive framework, we predicted growth rates across 16 lignin-derived substrate-oxygen combinations, including held-out conditions, demonstrating that growth-relevant information is encoded in the proteome. Interpreting model reliance using Monte Carlo SHAP values and dependence-aware perturbation analyses revealed a compact, hierarchical organization of growth determinants. Despite pronounced oxygen-driven bifurcation in proteome abundance, the features required for accurate growth prediction were largely regime-invariant, defining a conserved biochemical core overlaid by adaptive, condition-specific modulators. These findings reconcile metabolic versatility with constrained growth control and show that diverse lignin-derived substrates converge onto a limited set of proteome-encoded growth bottlenecks accessed through flexible regulatory programs."

    "content": "Oleaginous microalgae, such as Nannochloropsis oceanica, hold strong promise for sustainable lipid bioproduction, but fully realizing this potential requires systems-level insight into their complex metabolism. One of the central challenges in optimizing lipid productivity is the resolution of the highly heterogeneous and incompletely annotated metabolic networks, which respond dynamically to strain-specific traits and cultivation conditions. Here we present iSO1949_N.oceanica, the first genome-scale constraint-based metabolic model (GEM) for this species. Constructed through an orthology-based approach using curated models of related microalgae, the GEM integrates core photosynthetic metabolism and lipid biosynthesis pathways with extensive subcellular localization predictions. To capture environmental dynamics, we introduce two light-acclimation modes derived from continuous cyclostat cultivations, incorporating biomass composition, oxygen exchange, and maintenance rates based on photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Simulations reproduce carbon assimilation under variable light conditions and differentiate acclimated phenotypes. iSO1949_N.oceanica provides a comprehensive framework for exploring photosynthetic metabolism and guiding engineering strategies under photobioreactor-relevant conditions. This resource advances the use of N. oceanica as a chassis for sustainable lipid production and establishes a foundation for systems-level analysis of stramenopile microalgae."

Recent studies have questioned the source of these natural products whether production occurs through the sponge, its diverse microbiota, or perhaps a combination of both. While studying the uptake of engineered bacterial strains by sponges, we have observed production of fistularin-3 in sponge. To explore these results further, we employed multimodal imaging techniques to co-localize microbial metabolites with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. Here, we built on previously developed MALDI-FISH methods to add to the conversation on brominated metabolite production in marine sponges. Using MALDI-MSI, we measured fistularin-3, a poly-brominated natural product previously isolated from Aplysina aerophoba, present in our A. aerophoba samples that were inoculated with Pseudovibrio brasiliensis. A recent study reported that P. brasiliensis produced fistularin-3 in pure culture, but this data has not yet been reproduced. We employed MALDI-MSI and FISH on the same sponge cryosections to colocalize the spatial distribution of fistularin-3 with P. brasiliensis in sponge tissue. Despite the caveats of this study, our data suggests that perhaps both sponge and microbe may be required for production of fistularin-3."

    "content": "The symbiotic relationship between the microbiota and the host is crucial to host health. The reproductive tract microbiota in health and disease was examined by next-generation sequencing for the first time in this study. A total of 10 healthy and 30 diseased samples were collected for microbiota analysis. Species distributions, alpha diversity, beta diversity, and functional gene prediction were analyzed. Riemerella anatipestifer, Escherichia coli, Avibacterium paragallinarum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter baumannii were first identified as pathogenic bacteria at higher abundance in the reproductive tract of the laying hens. The diseased group exhibited dysbacteriosis and a different species-abundance cluster compared with the healthy control. Alpha-diversity analysis showed that the ACE index in the control group was significantly higher than in the diseased group. Beta diversity analysis indicates that samples from the healthy group had a more similar composition than those from the diseased group. Moreover, functional gene prediction analysis indicated that diseased groups showed a high level of gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, and potentially pathogenic bacteria. The pathogenic bacteria identified in this study are helpful for vaccine development and disease treatment. In conclusion, next-generation sequencing is an effective method for analyzing bacterial communities to support health assessment and disease diagnosis."

The silver-ruthenium antimicrobial AGXX exerts potent bactericidal effects through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, its potential synergy with antibiotics has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we show that sublethal concentrations of AGXX strongly enhance aminoglycoside-mediated killing across a diverse panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive MDR clinical isolates, including highly aminoglycoside-resistant strains. Combinational treatments significantly reduced the effective concentrations of gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin required for bacterial killing. Mechanistic analyses revealed that AGXX/aminoglycoside co-treatment induces a pronounced intracellular ROS accumulation, leading to severe proteotoxic stress, extensive protein aggregation, and DNA damage. Scavenging ROS abolished synergistic killing, establishing oxidative imbalance as the primary driver of the synergy between both antimicrobials. We further identify polyphosphate as a key bacterial defense mechanism that mitigates ROS accumulation, proteotoxicity, and genotoxic stress during combinational treatment. Moreover, AGXX/aminoglycoside synergy was preserved in artificial urine medium and across clinical UPEC isolates, underscoring the relevance for urinary tract infections. Together, these findings position AGXX as a potent aminoglycoside adjuvant that restores antibiotic efficacy through ROS-driven macromolecular damage, supporting its development for combination therapies against MDR bacterial infections."

    "content": "The capacity to methylate sterol side-chains via sterol methyltransferases (SMTs) was thought to be widespread in fungi, algae, and plants but limited in animals and nonexistent in bacteria. We have previously demonstrated that yet-uncultured bacteria have the genomic capacity to produce side-chain methylated sterols de novo. Further, we identified three bacterial SMTs capable of producing 24-isopropyl sterols and showed that each of these SMTs was biochemically sufficient for all three of the side-chain methylation steps necessary for 24-isopropyl sterol synthesis. To date, no eukaryotic SMT has been identified that is capable of sequentially adding three methyl groups to generate this propyl structure. To better understand this unique biochemical feature of bacterial SMTs and to potentially identify key amino acid residues involved in sequential methylations on the sterol side-chain, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of propylating bacterial SMTs. Through these analyses, we identified a glycine residue that is necessary but not sufficient for side-chain propylation. This residue is located outside known SMT substrate-binding domains, but inside the active site of an SMT protein model docked with 24-methylenecholesterol. We also show that phenylalanine residues in sterol-binding Region I increase the production of 24-isopropyl sterols, and that 25 residues are conserved among methylating, ethylating, and propylating SMTs. Together, the presence of these residues may allow us to predict if an organism has the genomic capacity to produce C-24 propylated sterols directly from sequencing data, and to generate hypotheses about the environments in which bacterial sterol side-chain propylation may be occurring through analysis of metagenomes. Given the high preservation potential of side-chain alkylated sterols and their use as molecular fossils indicative of ancient life deep in time, a better understanding of the distribution of these unique lipids in modern life and present-day ecosystems will allow for more robust interpretations of side-chain alkylated steranes in the rock record."

Bacteria have been implicated in the etiology of SCTLD, but the community of bacteria and archaea may also contribute to SCTLD resistance. To identify potential mechanisms through which microbes contribute to SCTLD resistance, we sequenced metagenomes from 41 colonies of the threatened coral, Orbicella faveolata, in the lower Florida Keys. All colonies were fate-tracked for three to five years and disease lesions were treated with amoxicillin. By 2024, 20% were never diseased, 10% had lesions before sampling but recovered, 22% were apparently healthy but were eventually susceptible to infection, and 49% had regular repeated infections. Within the coral microbiome, diseased and yet-to-be diseased colonies exhibited higher variability in functional genes. In contrast, corals that remained unaffected or recovered had less variable microbiomes with greater abundances of vitamin and antibiotic biosynthesis, secretion system, and quorum sensing genes that may support host health and resilience to pathogens. Though on some colonies antibiotic treatments were applied repeatedly, there was no effect on the diversity of beta-lactamases, antibiotic resistance genes that may confer amoxicillin resistance. Additional potentially probiotic gene clusters for the production of antimicrobial and bioactive compounds were present in many colonies regardless of fate. Taken together, we find significant probiotic potential in the coral microbiome to armor host O. faveolata corals against SCTLD infection, which may underpin intraspecific variation in stony coral tissue loss disease resilience and susceptibility."

    "content": "Influenza A virus segment 7 encodes the M1 matrix protein and M2 ion channel from an unspliced primary transcript mRNA1 and spliced mRNA2, respectively. Both proteins are essential for efficient virus replication, but the intrinsic sequences that determine segment 7 splicing balance are not fully defined. Here, we systematically investigated how conserved cis-acting splicing elements regulate 7 splicing. We found that while the splice acceptor sequence is optimal, both potential upstream polypyrimidine tracts regulate splicing, the 5' region acting positively and the 3' region negatively to maintain M1 expression. We could not unambiguously identify the mRNA2 branch point, but two closely spaced motifs can act redundantly. Saturation mutagenesis of the mRNA2 splice donor sequence showed that it is nearly optimal but that nucleotides 51 and 55 modestly downregulate splicing efficiency. Most introduced mutations that change splicing balance are nonsynonymous in M1. Nevertheless, mutations in the polypyrimidine tract and branch points that significantly perturbed M1:M2 balance resulted in viable viruses. In contrast, the splice donor sequence was intolerant of mutation. We conclude that M1:M2 balance is maintained via suboptimal splice donor and polypyrimidine tract splicing signals, with the latter allowing more evolutionary flexibility to vary the ratio and/or M1 sequence."

Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a popular model cyanobacterium, yet there are ambiguities in the precise coding regions of many genes, and numerous genes encoding small proteins have remained undetected. Here we present the results of a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) analysis involving inhibitors that stall ribosomes at translation initiation and termination sites (TIS- and TTS-Ribo-seq), combined with a proteogenomic reevaluation and reannotation of its entire genome. We report evidence for the translation of 3,050 annotated genes based on proteogenomics (83%), of 3,492 based on Ribo-seq (95.2%), and of 3,009 supported by both methods (82%). The data suggested both novel protein-coding genes and corrections for annotated ones. We validated 15 novel small proteins translated from antisense RNAs, from intergenic and intragenic regions and identified 69 novel, mostly small proteins based on proteogenomics. With slr0489, slr1079 and slr1082 we identified three genes with ~300 nt long intragenic out-of-frame coding regions and show that both the internal and host reading frames are translated. The resulting proteins interact with each other, resembling certain defense or toxin-antitoxin systems. Our data illustrate the enormous value of consolidating genome annotations in the context of integrated experimental data and suggest that genome annotations in general need to be extended and revised.

Here, we show that cytosolic redox dynamics critically govern cell cycle transitions in Caulobacter crescentus. By integrating evolutionary genetics with fluxomics, we uncover temporally orchestrated shifts in core metabolic pathways that remodel cytosolic redox across the cell cycle. Early stages channel carbon flux toward unsaturated fatty-acid synthesis and a reverse-TCA to drive cytosolic oxidation-coupled G1-S transition. The later stages depend on an enhanced forward-TCA cycle that promote cytosolic reduction-driven proliferation. Strikingly, perturbing fatty-acid synthesis or reverse/forward-TCA uncouples growth from proliferation. Intriguingly, a biphasic glucose uptake program dictates the cell cycle-stage-specific metabolism. These findings reveal an unprecedented metabolic-redox circuitry coordinating morphogenesis with cell cycle progression in a carefully choreographed menage a trois."

Mobilization of these resistance genes to pathogens results in the dissemination of multidrug resistance when exposed to differential antibiotic pressure. To determine the evolution of resistance, we employed adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) in Streptomyces coelicolor under gradually increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin, starting at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 4X MIC. The evolved strain CipRr exhibited elevated resistance towards ciprofloxacin with cross-resistance to other fluoroquinolones, such as ofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and collateral sensitivity to the protein synthesis inhibitors chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Compared to the WT cells, CipRr showed elevated production of secondary metabolites actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin, altered morphology, and reduced ROS production. Whole Genome Sequencing revealed mutations in transcriptional regulators and other metabolic genes, leading to enhanced activity of efflux pumps that conferred high-level ciprofloxacin resistance. Overall, this study demonstrates that evolutionary strategies in antibiotic producers such as streptomyces can help uncover the genetic determinants linked to antibiotic resistance, secondary metabolism, and morphological differentiation."

    "content": "The rising rate of drug-resistant fungal infections and the emergence of fungal pathogens with intrinsic resistance phenotypes are a growing concern. The close evolutionary distance between mammals and fungi complicates the design of new antifungals and increases the chances of toxic off-target effects. As such, antifungal drug development usually focuses on fungal-specific proteins when considering potential new targets. Ideal drug targets should mediate essential cell processes and be highly sensitive to inhibition. Targeted gene repression can serve as a model for drug-mediated inhibition and for determining the dosage-sensitivity profile of genes of interest. In the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, classical approaches for gene repression can be labour-intensive and limited to one genetic background due to low throughput. Here, we adapt pooled CRISPRi in C. albicans for the first time and exploit this technique for large-scale functional genomic analysis. Through pooled CRISPRi screening, we test the repression sensitivity of over a hundred essential genes conserved in fungi but absent in humans in a single flask, and successfully identify highly dosage-sensitive genes across multiple cell components and pathways. We further extended our analysis to ten diverse environmental conditions, allowing us to measure how the environment influences dosage-sensitivity profiles. Finally, we extend our experiments to two clinical drug-resistant C. albicans strain backgrounds and demonstrate that many of the fitness defects we observed are conserved in resistant clinical isolates. Together, our results highlight a set of genes that are highly dosage-sensitive across different genetic and environmental contexts, making them attractive targets for further investigation. By facilitating rapid, efficient large-scale functional genomics assays across diverse genetic backgrounds, CRISPRi pooled screening will open new frontiers in C. albicans biology."

We discovered an orally efficacious broad-spectrum non-nucleoside inhibitor of orthoparamyxovirus polymerases. However, here we found that tolerability in higher mammals was limited to 50 mg/kg b.i.d., close to the lowest efficacious dose. We report development of a clinical candidate analog, GHP-88310 (EIDD-3608), which combines improved oral efficacy with favorable tolerability in non-rodent species (ferrets and dogs), greatly expanding the therapeutic window. GHP-88310 had potent activity against the primary indication, HPIV3 and related respiroviruses, and the secondary indication, MeV and related morbilliviruses. In 7-day multi-dose tolerability studies, daily doses of 2,000 mg/kg were well-tolerated. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed an altered plasma exposure profile after oral delivery of GHP-88310 compared to the original hit. In the HPIV3 cotton rat model, GHP-88310 significantly reduced viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract when administered orally at 50 mg/kg twice daily. Therapeutic administration to ferrets infected with canine distemper virus (CDV), causing lethal measles-like disease, resulted in complete survival, significant reduction of primary viremia and shed viral load, and alleviated lymphocytopenia. Once-daily GHP-88310 was efficacious at respective 50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg in the CDV ferret and HPIV3 cotton rat models. The compound was sterilizing against HPIV3 at pharmacokinetics-informed dynamic concentrations in disease-relevant human airway epithelium organoids. These results identify GHP-88310 as a candidate for urgently needed improved orthoparamyxovirus disease management."

    "content": "The phages used to treat bacterial infections in phage therapy are commonly chosen based on their abilities to form plaques on the infecting bacterium -- on host range. In practice, phage therapy is not always successful, leaving room for improvement. Here we use computational models to investigate whether some standard phage properties (burst size, lysis, adsorption, decay rate, growth rate) might serve as predictors of treatment success. As our measure of treatment success, we deviate from many other approaches by calculating the number of phage needed to suppress bacterial densities 100-fold in the short term, given that the patient's immune system is expected to regain control once bacterial numbers are reduced. Numerical analysis of 2400 combinations of different values of phage phenotypes reveals that, on average, adsorption rate and growth rate provide the most useful predictive values, decay rate provides some value, whereas burst size and lysis time offer essentially little or no value. Bacterial density is especially informative of the number of phage required for treatment. There is nonetheless often considerable variation around average behavior for a single phenotype. These results raise the possibility that adsorption rate and growth rate may be especially important in phage therapy performance for both high and low bacterial densities. Given that therapeutic phages are often evolved in vitro for broad host ranges rather than for individual hosts, it should be considered that selection for broad host range may have a downside of compromising adsorption to and growth rate on individual bacterial hosts."

They are essential for nitrogen cycling in engineered and natural environments, yet little is known about their viruses or the consequences of phage infection for host physiology. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel lytic bacteriophage, vB_NeuP-Nir1 (Nir1), infecting the model AOB Nitrosomonas europaea . Phage Nir1 was highly virulent, ceased ammonia oxidation within hours, and caused complete lysis of host populations even at multiplicities of infection as low as 10-6. Electron microscopy revealed drastic host cell remodeling during infection, including pronounced cell bloating and large-scale disintegration of intracytoplasmic membranes. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that loss of these ATP and reducing equivalent generating membrane systems was accompanied by signatures of compromised lipid homeostasis and collapse of autotrophic CO2 fixation. In parallel, Nir1 infection induced metabolic rewiring of the host, including upregulation of uptake systems for nucleic acids, amino acids, and small organic compounds, increased expression of iron acquisition and putative iron-dependent respiratory components, as well as accumulation of metabolites associated with membrane breakdown and stabilization of viral DNA. Together, these results provide the first detailed mechanistic insight into phage-induced host modulation in a chemolithoautotrophic nitrifier. Our study establishes the Nir1-N. europaea system as a model for investigating virus-host interactions in AOB and lays the foundation for assessing the role of phages in shaping nitrification and nitrogen cycling in engineered and natural ecosystems."

In Bacillus subtilis, PG synthesis involves class A PBPs that act independently and class B PBPs that function in complexes for cell elongation (the elongasome) and division (the divisome). Here, we identify RpdA (formerly YufK) as a specific regulator of PBP4. Inactivation of either vegetative class A PBP (PBP1 or PBP4) by the {beta}-lactam antibiotic cefuroxime (CEF) is toxic and their loss confers CEF resistance. Similarly, loss of RpdA increases CEF resistance and genetic epistasis studies reveal that RpdA functions in a pathway with PBP4. In the absence of RpdA, PBP4 is no longer membrane localized. Analysis of a predicted RpdA-PBP4 protein complex suggests that RpdA has a second function in addition to serving as a membrane scaffold. Induction of RpdA reduces sensitivity to an undecaprenyl-phosphate binding antibiotic, consistent with a role in recycling of this important lipid carrier. We conclude that RpdA is a PBP4 accessory protein critical for its localization and activity."

The intensity and duration of bloom peaks in Florida estuaries vary interannually, but life cycle transitions, estuarine water residence time, water temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations appear to contribute to bloom formation. However, the impact of B-vitamin availability on P. bahamense bloom formation has not been investigated, despite the knowledge that many HAB dinoflagellates require B-vitamins for growth and bloom development. In this study, we determined that of the three B-vitamins most commonly required by marine phytoplankton--biotin (B7), thiamine (B1), and cobalamin (B12)--P. bahamense strictly requires an exogenous B12 source to support growth. As bacterial interactions can fulfill phytoplankton B12 requirements, we tested whether bacterial communities recruited from two Florida estuaries could rescue P. bahamense from B12 limitation. We demonstrate that bacteria from the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuary collected during a P. bahamense bloom restored P. bahamense growth in media missing B12, while bacteria present in Old Tampa Bay (OTB) water collected when P. bahamense was not present did not restore P. bahamense growth in media missing B12. Putative bacterial B12 producers exclusively recruited from IRL included Enterobacteraceae genera that likely have anthropogenic sources. Our findings suggest B12 is essential for fueling P. bahamense blooms, and that specific bacterial communities may contribute to bloom development through B12 production."

Recently, catechin amendment of thawed permafrost soil microcosms demonstrated >80% decrease in methane production over 35 days compared to unamended controls, with metagenome, metatranscriptome and metabolome analyses revealing a shift in prokaryotic carbon metabolism from a syntrophic network feeding methanogens to one dominated by catechin fermentation. Here we leverage these same data to investigate potential virus impacts on this microbial community metabolism shift. In total, 900 DNA virus operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) were identified as actively lytic based on transcribed structural and lysis genes. Of these, 41% were predicted to infect at least one of 56 transcriptionally active prokaryote genera representing 13 phyla. The most active vOTUs were predicted to infect key catechin-degrading genera including Clostridium and undescribed Bacillota genus JAGFXR01. Temporally, viral communities responded later than prokaryotes to catechin amendment, reflecting a virus production lag to targeting key microbial responders. An induced prophage represented by a vOTU predicted to infect JAGFXR01 dominated the catechin-amended viral community response. It reached abundances 20-156 times higher than its host, suggesting intense viral lysis that could release degraded catechin intermediates. Indeed, catechin intermediate gene expression in non-catechin-degraders were elevated in catechin-amended samples, suggesting JAGFXR01 lysis products were taken up by non-catechin-degraders as part of community carbon metabolism rewiring. Together, these results potentially place viruses at the heart of carbon rewiring that modulates ecosystem outputs of climate-critical thawing permafrosts."

    "content": "We have discovered a new family of genes encoding potential antimicrobial peptides with unique compact and elegant structure in the genomes of several Fungi and some arthropod species. Their expression products are constituted of about 85 amino acids, including a signal peptide, and are folded into two -helical segments connected by a short unstructured coil. Three conserved disulphide bridges between cysteines located in symmetrically mirrored positions connect the two helical domains. The two ends of the chain are thus brought together and the elongated and compact shape suggests that of a nail, potentially able to penetrate the cell membrane. A high abundance of hydrophobic residues supports such hypothesis. These peptides, that we name Hairpin Loop Peptides (HLPs), have been found in the genomes of many Fungi species but only in selected clades. Orthologues have also been discovered in the genomes of some insects, notably Hemiptera, a few other arthropods and other organisms, but are absent in plants. They appear to have originated in Fungi and then migrated to insects through horizontal gene transfer. The antimicrobial activity of HLPs is predicted by several software programmes, although this still needs to be confirmed by experimental evidence. The occurrence of HLPs in several edible mushrooms supports potential uses of these peptides in food preservation and possibly also in medical applications. Their simple and nearly rigid structure can be easily modified to improve specificity, stability and solubility, thus making these molecular weapons suitable for a variety of different applications."

    "content": "Background: Respiratory pathogens such as adenoviruses (AdV) and influenza A viruses (IAV) can cause serious upper and lower respiratory infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. However, options for antiviral drugs targeting respiratory viruses are limited. Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are disulfide-rich peptides that demonstrate broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses, while also playing immunomodulatory roles. Among defensins, human beta-defensins (hBDs) are the most prevalent, with six peptides identified: hBD-1 through hBD-6. Nonetheless, the production of hBD-3 during respiratory virus infections has not been extensively studied, nor has the effect of hBD-3 on these infections. Objective: This study investigated whether infection with AdV-5 or IAV induces hBD-3 expression in human airway epithelial cells and whether a recombinant form of hBD-3 (rhBD-3) can inhibit in vitro infection by these viruses, one DNA virus and one RNA virus. Methods: In vitro models of human airway epithelial cells (A549 and HEp-2) infected with AdV-5 and IAV were established. In vitro expression of hBD-3 mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR; hBD-3 protein was examined using immunofluorescence and Western blot. The inhibition of viral infection by hBD-3 was quantified using cytopathic effect and plaque reduction assays. Additionally, epithelial cells of animal origin, MDCK and MDBK, were similarly tested for rHBD-3 antiviral activity against IAV infection. Results: IAV and AdV infections significantly increased hBD-3 mRNA levels in A549 and HEp-2 cells. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting confirmed the presence of hBD-3 protein on the surface of IAV-infected cells. Cells infected with AdV-5 produced less hBD-3 protein. Additionally, rhBD-3 inhibited both AdV-5 and IAV infections in both cell lines at concentrations of 7.5-50 g/mL, with the strongest effect at the highest concentration. Lastly, rhBD-3 also inhibited IAV infection in MDBK and MDCK cells within the same range. Conclusions: In vitro infection of human airway epithelial cells with IAV and AdV induces hBD-3 mRNA and protein expression. In turn, rhBD-3 inhibits viral infection in a dose-dependent manner in HEp-2 and A549 cells against these viruses, an RNA virus and a DNA virus. hBD-3 is expressed and localized on the surface of infected cells. rHBD-3 also inhibits IAV infection in bovine and canine epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that hBD-3 plays a broad-spectrum role in defense against respiratory viruses in humans and animals and modulates the innate immune responses. Perspective: This work supports the use of hBD-3 as a natural, broad-spectrum antiviral agent, either alone or in combination, for treating viral infections, particularly emerging respiratory agents such as IAV and coronaviruses, for viral pandemic preparedness and response."

    "content": "Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and claims 610,000 deaths annually. Parasite invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) involves secretion of multiple proteins from specialised apical organelles (micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules). These collectively facilitate host cell entry, establish a protective parasitophorous vacuole (PV), and directly and indirectly mediate interactions between the infected RBC (iRBC) and the endothelial wall. The cytoadherence of iRBCs results in sequestration within organs and plays a critical role in pathogenesis and virulence, but the function of many secreted parasite proteins remains poorly characterised. Here, we leverage spatial proteomics from Plasmodium falciparum to identify two novel Plasmodium berghei orthologue proteins containing hydrolase domains (MAP1, PBANKA_1425900, and RhoSH, PBANKA_1001500). Ultrastructure expansion microscopy reveals their localisation to the rhoptries in late schizogony, where co-immunoprecipitation assays show they interact with each other. In vivo studies demonstrate that these proteins help the parasite evade spleen-mediated clearance and contribute to disease progression. Deletion of both genes disrupts lipid metabolism and PV membrane morphology, suggesting a role in establishing or maintaining the protective PV membrane. Loss of map1 reduces sequestration of P. berghei iRBCs to adipose tissue, and conditional knockdown of the P. falciparum map1 orthologue results in reduced CD36-mediated cytoadhesion, suggesting a cross-species role in sequestration and cytoadherence. Our findings identify MAP1 and RhoSH as key mediators of Plasmodium virulence."

    "content": "Many pathogens, both those with human spillover potential as well as avian-specific viruses, are maintained in wild bird populations. While much surveillance for influenza A viruses (IAVs) is performed annually, surveillance for other pathogens is limited. Sampling of wild birds is often time-consuming, labour-intensive, involves physically handling wild birds, often limited in sample size, and involves handling of potentially infected birds, posing an increased risk of direct exposure for personnel. Given this, additional methods for surveillance are needed. Longitudinal, bi-weekly fecal and sediment sampling was performed at various sites in southern Manitoba, Canada, particularly focused in Winnipeg from May - October 2025. Sites were chosen based on the suitability of the area for waterfowl habitat, the presence of waterfowl in the area, as well as sites in proximity to reported outbreaks of H5N1 influenza virus. Fecal and sediment samples were collected and screened for the presence of influenza A virus (IAV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian reovirus (ARV), and avian poxvirus (APXV). In total, 782 combined fecal and sediment samples were collected. Of the 714 fecal samples, 34 tested positive for IAV (4.8% prevalence). None of the IAV-positive fecal samples tested positive for H5 RNA. Of the 68 sediments tested, 15 tested positive for IAV (22.1% prevalence), four of which further tested positive for H5 RNA. NDV positivity was low, with only four positive fecal samples (0.56% prevalence) that were all collected on the same day. ARV positivity was also low, with five positive sediment samples (7.4% prevalence in sediment samples). Of the 782 total samples collected, of 559 samples that have been tested for APXV to date, all have tested negative. This work expands upon previous work showing the utility of environmental sampling for a variety of avian and zoonotic pathogens using a One Health approach that is both high-throughput and low-risk."

Our results suggest that the official N2K site information stored in the Standard Data Forms greatly under-report managers' assessment of vulnerability. Around half of the surveyed managers implemented adaptation strategies, which, when characterised following a Resist-Accept-Direct framework, aimed not only at resisting, but also at directing and accepting the effects of climate change. Managers also highlighted the need for scientific knowledge on local vulnerability and increased funding to improve the implementation of adaptation strategies inside protected areas."

    "content": "The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), a coastal cetacean species widely distributed from the Taiwan Strait to the Persian Gulf, is an iconic species that may represent an overall status indicator of marine ecosystems. However, growing anthropogenic pressures have led to declines in the population of this species in many regions such as Hong Kong waters, highlighting the need for more efficient and reliable monitoring methods. In this study, we applied two environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis methods, species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) and cetacean-targeting metabarcoding using Ceta prmers, to detect Indo-Pacific finless porpoises' eDNA in Hong Kong waters. First, we empirically validated the performance of the qPCR primers previously designed in another study. Then, in March 2025, water samples were collected from surface and bottom water layers in 20 locations in the Soko Islands area, a major habitat of the Indo-Pacific finless porpoises. The qPCR analysis detected the finless porpoise eDNA in eight out of 40 samples, but all of the eDNA concentrations were below the limit of quantification. Ceta metabarcoding detected the finless porpoise eDNA from seven out of 40 samples. The qPCR and Ceta metabarcoding approaches showed comparable detection rates for Indo-Pacific finless porpoise. Interestingly, the Ceta metabarcoding method detected a transient cetacean species, the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), from a single location. Both methods showed consistent detection rates between surface and bottom water layers, with no statistically significant difference. Overall, the two eDNA analysis methods successfully detected the finless porpoise eDNA in Hong Kong waters, demonstrating the potential of these approaches for monitoring the Indo-Pacific finless porpoises and other cetaceans in this region. Taken together, our findings provide a basis for an eDNA-based cetacean monitoring framework in Hong Kong waters."

    "content": "Species are dramatically shifting their geographical ranges, yet the consequences of these spatial redistributions on species interactions have not been examined at broad spatial and temporal scales. Here, we investigate how the redistribution of species abundance over the past 50 years affects the potential for predator-prey interactions among North American birds. We first predict potential predator-prey interactions based on existing data and functional traits, then construct a novel, abundance-weighted metric of interaction potential for each pair of predator and prey in local communities. Across North America, the potential for predator-prey interactions has been increasing over time. We further show that this widespread increasing trend in interaction potentials is mostly driven by higher abundances of predator species. The spatial redistributions of predators and prey lead to turnover of interactions within local communities, and the turnover is less associated with changes in climate but more associated with human-induced land use changes. Our novel approach and results highlight the importance of considering traits, abundance, and species interactions - including known and potential interactions - when studying the ecological consequences of species range shifts."

This study aimed to elucidate the structural dynamics underlying prey digestion in Nepenthes khasiana using high-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) integrated with biochemical characterization of the pitcher fluid. Three-dimensional morphometric analysis of the invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes, experimentally incubated in N. khasiana pitcher fluid, was conducted to assess time-dependent structural degradation. Quantitative micro-CT parameters, including volume, surface area, and surface-to-volume ratio, were analyzed to visualize and quantify time-dependent structural degradation and three-dimensional morphological changes in the prey during digestion. A triphasic digestion sequence was identified - comprising rapid soft-tissue hydrolysis, progressive exoskeletal fragmentation, and stabilization of chitinous remnants. The acidic, enzymatic fluid (pH 2.5-4.0) promoted uniform degradation through synergistic enzymatic, oxidative, and acidification processes, while dissolved CO2 enhanced acid stability and catalytic efficiency. The integration of micro-CT morphometrics and biochemical insights reveals a coordinated digestion mechanism in N. khasiana, optimized for efficient prey breakdown and nutrient assimilation."

    "content": "Marine microbial populations play essential roles in ocean ecosystems, yet the processes shaping their genomic structure across space and time remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the population-scale patterns of 1,505 prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) retrieved from the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea in two long-term coastal time series, along 15 and 7 years in these sites, as well as in the global ocean. We found that populations were generally more genomically differentiated across large spatial scales than across long temporal scales. Among a subset of 389 MAGs well represented in all datasets, 68.4% showed weak population divergence over time but strong global-scale differentiation. This was evident in the abundant and widespread cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. In contrast, only 6.4% of the MAGs exhibited weak divergence over time and space, with SAR11 MAGs being a clear example, likely reflecting their high dispersal and recombination rates. Other groups, such as SAR86 and Flavobacteriales, showed strong divergence at temporal and spatial scales, suggesting seasonal and/or regional adaptation. Positive selection was more readily detectable in the long-term coastal observatories than in the global ocean, despite the more significant population divergence observed across broad geographic scales. Temperature consistently showed a significant association with the population structure of many MAGs. Overall, our results highlight the dominant influence of large geographic scales in shaping microbial population structure alongside taxon-specific responses to temporal variation, particularly seasonality. Altogether, our work advances the understanding of microbial population structure across broad spatial and temporal scales, a critical step toward predicting microbial dynamics in a changing ocean."

Here, we present a machine learning pipeline that uses an ensemble modeling approach to detect flowers on herbarium specimens and deliver these data to the phenology research community. After testing multiple strategies for generating training data, we found in-house expert-curated annotations were essential for producing reliable results. Expert validation found relatively strong accuracy for detecting present floral structures, but still had moderately high false negative rates. Applying the ensemble to our filtered final image dataset of 22 million records resulted in 11.1 million records labeled with flowers present. However, only 2.9 million of these contained complete metadata necessary for downstream phenology research, highlighting the need for full label digitization efforts. Still, this dataset represents a large compilation of historical herbarium-derived phenology records available as a resource for the phenology community. We end by demonstrating how integrating these machine-labeled records into Phenobase, a publicly-available phenology database, expands taxonomic and temporal coverage for large-scale phenological analyses, and discuss remaining challenges and next steps."

With a bench-scale, continuous-loop setup circulating advanced-treated wastewater, we compared microbial community dynamics across three candidate porous media: native aquifer sediment, zirconia beads, and laboratory-grade silica sand. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that native aquifer sediment best reflected influent microbial composition and temporal shifts. Native aquifer sediment also exhibited more spatial consistency in microbial diversity along the sampler. These findings suggest that native aquifer sediment is an optimal porous medium for long-term, in situ monitoring of microbial communities for managed aquifer recharge and other applications in groundwater systems."

    "content": "Ecological communities are linked not only by energy flows, but also by sensory and behavioral pathways that allow organisms to locate, recognize, and interact with one another. Environmental stressors such as drought may disrupt these pathways by altering both resource availability and interactions that regulate both population and community dynamics. While species-level responses to drought are well documented, far less is understood about how drought-driven changes in plant resources initiate bottom-up effects that cascade through multiple trophic levels. Here, we tested how drought affects a plant-herbivore-carnivore system by quantifying plant physiological changes and their cascading effects on herbivore performance, nutritional quality, and carnivore behavior. Drought reduced plant growth and stomatal conductance, which lowered herbivore feeding efficiency, survival, and reproduction. Herbivores feeding on drought-stressed plants also displayed lower protein content and biomass. Drought also suppressed the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), limiting the chemical cues carnivores use to locate prey. Despite higher prey consumption rates in no-choice assays, carnivores suppressed herbivore populations less effectively under drought. At the community level, these disruptions caused disproportionate declines in arthropod abundance and diversity, particularly among carnivores, leading to trophic simplification. These findings show that drought not just reduce resource availability, it disrupts chemical cues and trophic feedbacks that maintain food web structure. By linking changes in resource limitations to community-level responses, this study demonstrates how environmental stressors can weaken top-down control and destabilize multitrophic dynamics. Predicting ecological resilience depends not only on responses but on how stress disrupts the information signals that maintain ecosystem services and function."

    "content": "Aim Phenotypic characters have long been central to species diagnosis and remain indispensable even in the age of genomics. However, phenotypic datasets are often complex, spanning dozens of traits of varying types and units, with correlated variables and unbalanced sampling, posing challenges for robust, reproducible analysis. Existing software solutions are fragmented, usually requiring labor-intensive workflows across multiple tools and manual steps, which undermines reproducibility and hinders comparisons across studies. To address these methodological and practical challenges, I introduce Orangutan, an R package designed to provide a flexible, easy-to-implement framework for comparing groups using mensural and meristic data. Innovation Orangutan provides a flexible and efficient framework for analyzing mensural and meristic data, supporting a full suite of statistical and visualization tools optimized for species diagnosis and population comparisons. The package streamlines the identification of diagnostic, non-overlapping traits between species, while enabling rigorous assessment of both individual and multivariate trait differences in overlapping traits. Core features include optional allometric correction to remove size effects, automated selection of appropriate univariate tests with post hoc comparisons, and integrated multivariate analyses. All outputs, including summary statistics and annotated publication-ready figures, are generated with minimal coding, ensuring accessibility and standardization. Main Conclusions Empirical validation with real-world datasets, including animal and plant species, demonstrates that Orangutan robustly identifies diagnostic traits, reveals both subtle and clear group differences, and achieves high classification accuracy with phenotypic data alone. By automating and unifying key analytical steps, Orangutan promotes reproducibility, transparency, and efficiency in phenotypic research. This package empowers researchers in taxonomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology to adopt quantitative best practices for species diagnoses, facilitating comparative studies and advancing methodological standards in morphological data analysis. Orangutan is freely available with comprehensive documentation to support widespread adoption."

Precipitation changes will increase fluctuations in surface soil salinity, and the same happens for thawed permafrost soil where stable salt concentrations are replaced with fluctuating salinity during annual freeze-thaw cycles. Both have unknown effects on the microbial communities and their emissions of microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs). These compounds are produced from various pathways mainly as secondary metabolites and have ecological and climatic implications when released into the environment and the atmosphere. Thus, it is important to explore the effects of environmental changes, such as changes in salinity, on soil microbial communities and their MVOC emissions. Here, we characterize the MVOC production of three novel bacterial isolates from northern Greenland throughout their growth period under low, moderate, and high salt concentrations. We demonstrate that salinity significantly alters both the quantity and composition of MVOCs emitted by all three strains, including changes in the emissions of sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds, potentially leading to ecosystem nutrient loss. The observed changes in MVOC profiles suggest that changes in soil salinity due to climate change could alter microbial metabolism and MVOC emissions, with potential implications for Arctic nutrient cycling and atmospheric chemistry.</span>"

Resistance determinants were screened by PCR and sequenced. We focused on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clostridia</span> that were present at low colonization levels (mean 5.3 log<sub>10</sub> CFU g<sup>\u22121</sup> of feces). While most isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, imipenem, and metronidazole, resistance to tetracycline (12%), clindamycin (35%), and cefotaxime (35%) was observed. Distinct species-specific resistance included linezolid (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clostridium argentinense</span>), chloramphenicol (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clostridium innocuum</span>), and tigecycline (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Paeniclostridium sordellii</span>), and one <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Robinsonella peoriensis</span> isolate displayed vancomycin resistance. The detection of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tet</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">erm</span> genes corresponded with phenotypic resistance, while \u03b2-lactamase activity was uncommon. Although colonizing at low levels, these findings highlight the ecological significance of rarely studied commensal <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clostridia</span> and their contribution to the neonatal resistome, acting as underappreciated reservoirs of AMR genes during a critical window of microbiome assembly.</span>"

Importantly, the processes subsurface microorganisms mediate are central to societal needs to mitigate climate change and address waste storage, as proposed solutions to both involve subsurface habitats. However, subsurface sampling opportunities and funding remain limited and, in some cases, have diminished. This perspective article is aimed at scientists who have or might develop an interest in the geomicrobiology of the subsurface, for funding agencies worldwide, and for scientists and engineers engaged in the extractive and waste disposal industries. It briefly reviews subsurface science\u2019s history and current status and proposes some actions for moving forward. In particular, we see the continued need for engaging early-career microbiologists in drilling projects, increasing access through industry partnerships, microbiology-led drilling projects, and creating interdisciplinary drilling projects by including microbiologists during the drilling project planning.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The secreted mucus layer in the human gastrointestinal tract constitutes both a protective boundary between gut lumen and epithelium as well as an important nutrient source for members of the gut microbiota. While many gut microbes possess the genetic potential to degrade mucin, it is still unclear which species transcribe the respective genes. Here, we systematically analysed publicly available metagenome and metatranscriptome datasets to characterize the gut microbial community involved in mucosal glycan degradation. We utilized cooccurrence network analysis and linear regression to elucidate the ecological strategies of, and relationship between, mucus degraders. We found that although ~60% of species carrying genes encoding for mucosal-glycan-degrading enzymes have detectable transcription of these genes, only 21 species prevalently transcribe more than 1 gene. Furthermore, the transcription of individual genes was frequently dominated by single species in individual samples. Transcription patterns suggested the presence of competitive mucosal glycan degraders characterized by abundance-driven transcription that were negative predictors for the transcription of other degraders as well as opportunistic species with decoupled abundance and transcription profiles. These findings provide insights into the ecology of the mucosal glycan degradation niche in the human gut microbiota.</span>"

However, little is known about the combined effects of regional temperature, microclimate, and dispersal vectors on fungal diversity. We studied the effect of microclimate and wood-inhabiting beetles serving as potential dispersal vectors on the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi in general\u2014and of brown- and white-rot fungi in particular\u2014along a regional temperature gradient. This focus is motivated by the critical role that different rot types play in wood decomposition and carbon cycling. Beetle and fungal communities were sampled in 243 logs of Norway spruce (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Picea abies</span>), which were placed along a 1200\u00a0km latitudinal gradient in Sweden (i.e. regional temperature gradient) and under different shading conditions (i.e. microclimatic gradient). Species richness of brown-rot fungi increased with beetle abundance in both the south and the north, whereas shade level markedly limited their species richness only in the north. In contrast, white-rot fungi were unaffected by either factor. These findings highlight that fungal responses to microclimate and dispersal vectors may differ between regions and suggest that species richness of brown-rot fungi may increase with a warming climate, especially in the north.</span>"

    "content": "Head direction (HD) signals function as the brain\u2019s internal compass. They are organized as an attractor and anchor to the environment via visual landmarks. Here, we examine how thalamic HD signals and visual information from the retrosplenial cortex combine in the presubiculum. We find that monosynaptic excitatory connections from anterior thalamic nucleus and from retrosplenial cortex converge on single layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal portion of mouse presubiculum. Independent dual-wavelength photostimulation of these inputs in slices leads to action potential generation preferentially for near-coincident inputs, indicating that layer 3 neurons can transmit a visually matched HD signal to medial entorhinal cortex. Layer 4 neurons, which innervate the lateral mammillary nucleus, form a second step in the association of HD and landmark signals. They receive little direct input from thalamic and retrosplenial axons. We show that layer 4 cells are excited di-synaptically, transforming regular spiking activity into bursts of action potentials, and that their firing is enhanced by cholinergic agonists. Thus, a coherent sense of orientation involves projection-specific translaminar processing in the presubiculum, where neuromodulation facilitates landmark updating of HD signals in the lateral mammillary nucleus."

To understand this we make a mechanistic link between cellular damage, survival curves, and maximum lifespan using a validated stochastic model of damage accumulation and extensive human data. We show that maximal lifespan is set mainly by damage production and clearance rates, as in progeroid syndromes. In contrast, lifestyle factors such as exercise, nutrition, and sleep chiefly reduce stochastic noise and raise the damage level compatible with survival, shifting the median but not the maximum. Similar constraints arise in other mortality models. Our analysis predicts that lifestyle can extend maximal lifespan by at most ~1 year; substantial gains will require directly perturbing damage production or removal, suggesting specific molecular targets."

    "content": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease with a high degree of intra- and interpatient heterogeneity. Current treatments almost uniformly employ the standardized \"7+3\" regimen, which is based on cytarabine combined with an anthracycline, with long-term survival rates below 30%. Our work specifically focuses on the cytarabine component of this regimen. Functionalist oncology utilizes edge-weighted digraphs as a representational tool to model the mathematical functional interdependencies of disease factors. This methodology enables a conceptual and mechanistic analysis of key factors influencing therapeutic success, providing a framework that can be parameterized to explore patient-specific treatment responses when suitable data are available. It incorporates the oligoclonal nature of AML to perform, in principle, comprehensive cost-benefit analyses regarding the addition of individual drugs to existing treatment regimens and the number and type of chemotherapy courses to be given. Extrapolating from experimental data, we investigate the therapeutic potential and risks of SAMHD1 inhibitors in AML treatment as a proof-of-concept. We also provide a web-based interactive application to visualize hypothetical AML treatment scenarios, which can be combined with ex vivo single-cell phenotypic (gene expression), genotypic (somatic mutations), and functional (drug responses) analyses. Functionalist oncology can thus be used to generate testable hypotheses that might contribute to improving oncological decision-making, e.g., by identifying the optimal number, nature and sequence of chemotherapy blocks, including both existing AML-directed blocks and additional drugs, such as SAMHD1 inhibitors."

    "content": "In response to environmental changes, bacteria have evolved sophisticated regulatory networks that incorporate small RNAs (sRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) to fine-tune cellular physiology. Both sRNAs and TFs modulate gene expression, but the former function via post-transcriptional mechanisms, while the latter act at the transcriptional level. However, it remains unclear why both regulatory layers are conserved through evolution, rather than one being sufficient. Here, we experimentally identified that CRP, a global regulator, regulates 25 small RNAs (sRNAs) in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, CRP also controls 80% of the target genes of these sRNAs. This architecture led us to identify 34 novel sRNA-mediated feed-forward loops (sFFLs) circuits where CRP regulates both an sRNA and its target within the CRP regulon. Quantitative PCR analysis of 16 such sFFLs revealed that each type possesses a distinct cAMP dose-response profile, suggesting that different sFFL structures embody unique regulatory logic. Specifically, coherent and incoherent type 3 and 4 sFFLs exhibit broader dynamic ranges in their dose-response compared to open-loop controls. Coherent and incoherent type 1 and 2 sFFLs appear more energy-efficient. Altogether, we propose that sRNAs cooperate with TFs through sFFLs to optimize both the energy efficiency and the diversity of signal response profiles. Therefore, sRNAs serve as critical components integrating transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks across diverse cellular pathways."

    "content": "5-oxoproline (5-OP) or pyroglutamic acid is an intermediate of the degradation arc of the glutathione cycle. It is metabolized into glutamate through the action of the 5-oxoprolinase enzyme, the only enzyme known to act on this metabolite. 5-OP has long been known to be relatively inert with a proposed role as an osomoprotectant. Recent studies on the 5-oxoprolinase enzyme in mammalian cells have, however, shown that knockdown or deletions of the 5-oxoprolinase make mice (and humans) prone to heart failure. This was ascribed to oxidative stress due to a two-fold elevation in 5-OP. To examine the consequences of 5-oxoproline accumulation more rigorously, we have created a yeast model for 5-oxoproline accumulation. We observed retardation of growth only when intracellular levels of 5-OP were increased 12-20 fold over the normal levels. A transcriptomics study was carried out under these conditions. We observed that while a large number of genes were regulated upto 2-fold, there were no single prominent pathways amongst them. Among the key genes upregulated were different efflux pumps. Using knockouts and also overexpression of selected genes, we could observe that many of the upregulated genes were involved in the cellular response to 5-OP accumulation. However, it did not appear that there was any significant oxidative stress response. The study suggests a need to reevaluate previous suppositions of the 5-OP induced oxidative stress response. Instead, we propose an alternative model to explain the possible consequences of 5-oxoprolinase deficiency based on these findings made with the yeast model."

    "content": "Cells are composite mechanical systems: a viscoelastic cytoplasm enclosed by a deformable cell cortex. These two components exchange forces continuously--fluid motion deforms the cortex, and cortical deformation in turn redirects intracellular flow. Yet most cellular mechanics simulations treat either the fluid or the cortex in isolation, leaving their mechanical interplay largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed a fluid-structure interaction framework based on the moving-particle semi-implicit (MPS) method that solves the coupled dynamics of cytoplasmic flow, internal pressure, and cortical elasticity. We applied this framework to cytokinesis, focusing on how the cleavage plane is positioned. While the mitotic spindle is known to specify the furrow site, prior work has emphasized biochemical cues emanating from the spindle, whereas a direct mechanical cue has been difficult to interrogate. Our simulations show that spindle elongation generates cytoplasmic flows that create a pressure minimum near the spindle midzone; when the cortex is modeled as an elastic shell, this pressure landscape drives a localized cortical invagination at that site. We therefore propose that spindle-driven cytoplasmic flow provides a mechanical positional cue for cleavage-furrow initiation."

Although many identified microbes can boost plant production under laboratory settings, most fail to translate to field settings, and even the ones that are commercialized are often unreliable. While many factors likely underlie these issues, one that has been underexplored is the idea that interactions between plants and microbes can vary across both different host genetics and different environments, and that specific combinations of host and environment can result in very different microbial outcomes. Results: To quantify how a plant microbiome can change across host genotype and environment and to determine the relative importance of these factors, we sampled maize stalks from 20 specific hybrid varieties grown at 15 locations in the United States. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we find that the stalk microbiome is highly variable, with a handful of bacterial taxa conserved at broader taxonomic levels (Phylum, Class) and almost none at finer levels (Genus, Species). Local environment and gene-by-environment interactions both had consistently large and significant effects on the microbial community (measured by alpha- and beta-diversity summary statistics, individual taxa, and inferred functional capacity), whereas host genotype had little to no consistent effect across environments. We also identified specific soil factors (pH and potassium) as the most significant environmental drivers of the community, even though these communities were living inside the stalks. Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that while host genetics can significantly affect the stalk microbial community, these effects are almost entirely predicated on interactions with the environment. These results imply that reliable deployment of microbes for crop production will require significant investment in trials across many locations and genetic backgrounds, either to estimate the GxE effects directly or to screen for microbes whose effects are less dependent on these two factors."

    "content": "Herpesviruses are widespread double-stranded DNA viruses that establish lifelong latency and cause various diseases. Although DNA polymerase-targeting antivirals are effective, increasing drug resistance underscores the need for alternatives. Helicase-primase inhibitors (HPIs) are promising antivirals, but their mechanisms of action are poorly defined. Furthermore, how the helicase-primase (H/P) complex and DNA polymerase coordinate genome replication is not well understood for herpesviruses. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) H/P complex bound to HPIs, showing that these lock the helicase-primase complex in an inactive conformation. Single-molecule assays reveal that HPIs cause helicase-primase complexes to pause in unwinding activity on DNA. The structure of an HPI-bound replication fork complex, comprising the H/P complex (UL5, UL52, and UL8) and polymerase holoenzyme (UL30 and UL42), reveals a previously uncharacterized interface bridging these complexes. These findings provide a structural framework for understanding herpesvirus replisome assembly and advancing inhibitor development."

    "content": "The O1 serogroup of Vibrio cholerae has caused all cholera pandemics and for over a century V. cholerae O1 outbreak strains have been characterized by their serotype. The two V. cholerae serotypes differ by the presence (Ogawa) or absence (Inaba) of methylation of the terminal sugar on the lipopolysaccharide O1-antigen. Serotype switching often occurs during epidemics and has historically been attributed to the pathogen adapting to immune pressures. Here we address the impact of serotype on V. cholerae pathogenicity using otherwise isogenic Ogawa and Inaba versions of several clinical V. cholerae O1 isolates. Our findings indicate that O1 antigen methylation in Ogawa strains promotes V. cholerae colonization, infectivity and resistance to antimicrobial peptides. We propose that methylation of the O1 antigen elevates colonization by shielding the bacterium from cationic antimicrobial peptides at the pH of the small intestine. These observations provide insights into the biological significance of the V. cholerae O1 serotypes."

    "content": "The growing number of patients susceptible to invasive Candida albicans infections has intensified the need for new antifungal targets in pathways essential for fungal growth and pathogenesis. Among these pathways, phosphate homeostasis has emerged as a significant determinant of virulence, yet how phosphate availability shapes cell wall structure in response to host-derived oxidative stress remains unclear. During commensal growth, C. albicans cells typically enjoy phosphate repletion and a neutral redox environment. Transitioning to invade host tissues, they simultaneously experience phosphate deprivation and intense extrinsic oxidative stress. Here, we employ solid-state NMR to render details of cell wall remodeling in response to oxidative stress, in its dependence on phosphate. Phosphate deprived cells remodel the rigid wall core and reduce hydration and polymer mobility in the absence of oxidative stress. During hydrogen peroxide exposure, highly mobile outer polysaccharides are primary interactors. In wildtype cells, some of these polymers are recruited into the rigid core, reinforcing the wall scaffold, whereas phosphate transport mutants fail to undergo this remodeling. These findings establish phosphate acquisition as a component of oxidative defense and link nutrient sensing and -availability to the mechanical resilience of the fungal cell wall, revealing an architectural vulnerability with relevance for antifungal development."

    "content": "Numerous studies have implicated both dietary intake and the human gut microbiome in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment outcomes. However, little is known about how patients adjust their dietary intake during cancer chemotherapy or if these dietary changes contribute to treatment-associated alterations in the gut microbiome. We performed paired longitudinal diet and microbiome analysis during CRC treatment with oral fluoropyrimidines (NCT04054908) and validated key associations using cell culture assays. Diet quality significantly decreased during chemotherapy. Carbohydrate and refined grain intake increased, accompanied by decreased consumption of fats, nuts and seeds, and fat-soluble micronutrients. Multiple individual dietary components were strongly linked to the gut microbiome. Decreases in theobromine intake correlated with decreases in overall microbial diversity and more gastrointestinal toxicities. Diet shifts partly explained changes in bacterial abundance during chemotherapy, including more severe depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in patients with decreased vitamin K1 intake. Changes in diet were correlated with multiple bacterial gene families involved in micronutrient metabolism and drug sensitivity. Increased copper intake was linked to decreased Fusobacterium nucleatum in patients and inhibited F. nucleatum in cell assays. Together, these data suggest that chemotherapy-related decreases in diet quality and micronutrient intake contribute to changes in gut bacterial diversity, taxonomic composition, and gene abundance. Our approach may generalize to other cancer therapies and emphasizes the need for collecting more robust dietary data in clinical microbiome studies."

Here, we deployed Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide-coated pumice stones in high-As, high-methane groundwater in Cambodia for 270 days to capture planktonic metal-reducing microbial communities in-situ. These were used to inoculate anaerobic microcosms with methane or volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as electron donors over 200 days. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed that methane oxidation via reverse methanogenesis led to acetate production, which in turn provided the primary electrons for Fe(III) and As(V) reduction in the microcosms, resulting in As(III) release. Our findings highlight an indirect coupling between methane oxidation and arsenic mobilization, with acetate as the key intermediate. This study offers new insights into the role of methane in subsurface biogeochemical cycling and its implications for arsenic contamination in groundwater systems."

Although flavivirus NS5 proteins inhibit IFN signaling through distinct mechanisms, which suggests evolutionary flexibility, the evolutionary constraints for these activities to coexist within a single protein remain to be determined. Here, we mapped the Zika virus NS5 STAT2 antagonism determinants and compared them with replication constraints defined by deep mutational scanning. Antagonism and replication determinant extensively overlapped, and no single amino acid substitution eliminated antagonism without impairing replication. Resolving these fitness landscapes in parallel identified specific combinations of partially functional substitutions that retained replication capacity while markedly reducing antagonism. These viruses were profoundly attenuated in human STAT2 knock-in mice. Our results uncover a fundamental evolutionary constraint linking replication and immune evasion activities in NS5, highlight that STAT2 antagonism is essential for ZIKV pathogenesis and provide new avenues for attenuated ZIKV vaccines."

    "content": "Does fermentation enhance the safety of beverages? This study investigates kombucha's resilience to microbial invasion from human hands. Kombucha, an ancient fermented tea, relies on a biofilm known as a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) and a starter culture to ferment sweet tea, producing various metabolites including gluconic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. While fermented foods have been historically associated with potential health benefits, direct evidence comparing the prevalence of human pathogens in fermented versus non-fermented beverages has been lacking. To address this, we conducted a citizen science experiment at Arizona State University, introducing swabs from people's palms into both kombucha and a sweet tea control. Over 30 days, we monitored the bacterial and fungal composition using 16S and ITS rRNA sequencing. Our findings reveal that kombucha maintained a relatively stable microbial profile and physical appearance, with a typical SCOBY biofilm developing. In stark contrast, the sweet tea experienced a dramatic change in microbial composition and was visibly compromised by rapidly growing microorganisms. Importantly, this suggests that the complex microbial ecosystem of kombucha can limit the growth of foreign microbes introduced from human hands. Given that human pathogens were absent from the kombucha while present in the tea samples, our results indicate that the antimicrobial properties of fermentation byproducts and the physical barrier of the SCOBY may contribute to this resilience. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying kombucha's resistance to microbial invasion."

Models for studying this type of gonococcal infection are few and limited. We have tested cornea models based on an immortalized hTCEpi corneal epithelium cell line for infection research using four derivatives of the N. gonorrhoeae MS11 strain that differ in pilus expression. We show that bacterial adherence depends on the functional type IV pilus in the early stages of infection, and that the formation of bacterial microcolonies and biofilms on the model surface leads to tissue destruction. The infection induces a specific cytokine response characterized by an increase in the secretion of IL-8 and TNF-a, but not of IL-6. The testing of trifluoperazine, a drug that induces pilus retraction, on infected corneal tissue models showed that the drug strongly diminished the number of adherent gonococci only when applied simultaneously with bacteria, and not when bacteria were allowed to form microcolonies on the tissue surface. Our work describes, for the first time, hTCEpi-based corneal epithelium tissue models as a useful tool for investigating N. gonorrhoeae infection, with potential for application in high-throughput studies and drug screening."

We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genomes of two Pss strains, LMG 5496 (from Citrus sinensis, Greece, 1962) and EC33 (from C. limon, Tunisia, 2014), to identify genetic determinants underlying their differential virulence. The genomes of LMG 5496 (6.23 Mb; 58.78% GC) and EC33 (5.98 Mb; 58.97% GC) contained 5,563 and 5,312 coding sequences, respectively, and shared highly conserved metabolic and functional profiles. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI {approx} 100%) and phylogenomic analyses confirmed their close evolutionary relationship within phylogroup 02b. Despite overall similarity, EC33 retained a complete repertoire of Type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors, while LMG 5496 exhibited deletions in two core effectors, correlating with reduced virulence. Functional annotation identified 16 high-confidence T3SS effectors, 12 shared and four strain-specific, reflecting divergent molecular strategies. Enhanced pathogenicity of EC33 was linked to the presence of hypervirulence gene Q4ZSY4 and loss of AvrPph3, suggesting host immune evasion. Both strains possessed largely conserved copper resistance genes, with minor differences in detoxification enzymes. Prophage profiling revealed distinct histories: LMG 5496 carried two intact prophages, EC33 one. This comparative genomic analysis provides new insights into adaptation, phenotypic diversification, and shaping virulence within clonal P. syringae lineages. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-based comparison of Pss strains isolated from Citrus."

While FLG null mutations are major genetic risk factors for AD, they explain only a fraction of disease heritability, suggesting a potential role for the skin microbiome. Objective: To determine how early-life skin microbiome composition and its interaction with host genetics contribute to distinct atopic phenotypes in infancy. Methods: We analyzed >1,000 skin swabs from 429 infants in the VITALITY cohort using deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing at 2-3 months (pre-diagnosis) and 12 months (post-diagnosis). Differential abundance, strain-level, and microbial genome-wide association analyses were performed to identify taxonomic and functional features associated with AD, FS, FA, and their co-occurrence, as well as with FLG mutation status. Results: Within AD, microbial signatures differed by co-occurring FA or FS. At 12 months, Staphylococcus epidermidis was enriched in infants with AD alone, whereas infants with AD and FA exhibited decreased Staphylococcus hominis and Lactococcus species, along with increased Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis and Malassezia slooffiae. At 2-3 months, early skin dysbiosis characterized by enrichment of Staphylococcus species was associated with subsequent development of AD with FS or FA, but not AD alone. Among infants with AD, FLG mutation carriers exhibited additional microbial shifts, including reduced Streptococcus species and increased Malassezia slooffiae. Strain-level analyses revealed mother-infant sharing of skin microbial taxa associated with AD, and microbial genome-wide association analyses identified species-specific genes linked to AD severity. Conclusions: Infant atopic phenotypes are associated with distinct, phenotype-specific features of the skin microbiome that emerge both before and after clinical disease onset. By resolving microbial differences within AD according to allergic co-occurrence, host genetics, and early-life timing, this study highlights the infant skin microbiome as a potential target for early risk stratification."

Although it was described as a new species in 2016, its fundamental characteristics, including historical occurrence, geographic distribution, and host range, remain poorly resolved. In this study, we re-identified strain GR1, which was originally isolated from a diseased Rumex plant in the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands in 1996 and deposited in a public bioresource center, together with the plant voucher specimen, and evaluated its host range. Colony and conidial morphology and a phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences identified GR1 as T. rumicicola. Morphological examination of the host plant voucher specimen confirmed Rumex japonicus as the natural host. Pathogenicity assays demonstrated that GR1 infected R. japonicus, reproduced the original disease symptoms, and was successfully re-isolated from diseased tissues, consistent with Koch's postulates. In addition, GR1 caused significant disease and shoot biomass reduction in R. japonicus, R. crispus and R. obtusifolius. The identification of GR1 reveals the presence of T. rumicicola in Japan approximately two decades prior to its formal description, representing the earliest known record of this species. Furthermore, this finding extends its known distribution from temperate regions to the subtropical Bonin Islands, a well-preserved and isolated ecosystem. This study documents for the first time R. japonicus as a natural host of T. rumicicola."

Ficolin-activated immunity in the liver sinusoids provides swift and sterilizing immunity in mice. Mice lacking ficolin-A (the only plasma ficolin) became hypersusceptible to the blood infections of the ficolin-A-recognizable bacterial serotypes. Mechanistically, plasma ficolins activate complement C3 on bacterial surfaces by pattern recognition of acetylated monosaccharides on polysaccharide capsules, and thereby deliver the opsonized bacteria to C3 receptors on Kupffer cells for phagocytic elimination. These findings reveal that plasma ficolins serve as pattern-recognition receptors that are essential for maintaining the bloodstream sterile."

    "content": "Historical salinization from ancient saltworks can leave a long-lasting imprint on coastal aquifers, but its impacts on subsurface microbial communities and ecosystem functioning remain poorly understood. This study examined how legacy salt inputs from Roman saltworks in the Tiber River delta (Fiumicino, Italy) continue to shape present-day groundwater chemistry, microbial community structure, and metabolic potential of the coastal aquifer. We analyzed groundwater samples from non-salinized and salinized units of the same aquifer using integrated hydrogeochemical characterization, flow cytometry, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and functional metabolic assays. Salinized samples exhibited elevated chloride, bromide, sodium, and sulfate concentrations, with distinctive ionic ratios (Br/Sr, Cl/K, SO/Ca) indicating dissolution of salt deposits rather than contemporary seawater intrusion. Salinization reduced the microbial diversity and shifted communities from diverse freshwater-adapted families toward an abundant halotolerant assemblage dominated by Campylobacterota (families Sulfurimonadaceae and Sulfurovaceae). Functional annotation suggested broadly conserved potentials for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. However, the Biolog assays revealed higher heterotrophic respiration and carbon substrate use but lower functional diversity in salinized samples, with particularly enhanced polymer degradation. Ordination analyses showed a clear separation of aquifer units along the salinization gradient, with coordinated chemical and microbial vectors indicating alternative ecosystem states sustained by millennia-old anthropogenic salt inputs. Our findings showed that ancient saltworks can drive persistent hydrogeochemical alteration, select specialized halotolerant microbiomes, and reconfigure carbon and nutrient processing while maintaining core biogeochemical functions, with critical implications for coastal groundwater management strategies."

In this study, we established and characterized an integrated in vitro and in vivo platform for CCHFV research. Virus propagation was optimized by comparing Vero E6 and SW-13 cell lines. SW-13 cells supported efficient CCHFV replication resulting in pronounced virus-induced cytopathic effects, whereas no detectable cytopathic effects were observed in Vero E6 cells. Virus titers determined by cytopathic effect based endpoint dilution and antigen ELISA coincided, supporting the use of SW-13 cells for virus stock preparation. Using virus stocks generated in SW-13 cells, interferon-deficient mice were infected with different doses of CCHFV to assess dose-dependent pathogenicity. Infection resulted in severe disease and high mortality across all tested doses. Based on survival analysis, a dose of 10 TCID50; was selected for further characterization, which revealed progressive weight loss and high viral loads in peripheral organs.

Despite their biological and translational significance, the cellular mechanisms governing OMV entry into host cells remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that E. coli OMVs are internalized by epithelial cells via clathrin-mediated, receptor-dependent endocytosis. Using a high-throughput screen of over 1,500 human single-pass transmembrane proteins, we identify T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain 1 (TIM-1) as a strong OMV-binding receptor. Functional validation revealed that TIM-1 overexpression markedly increased OMV uptake, whereas TIM-1 knockout and antibody-mediated blockade significantly impaired internalization across multiple cell lines. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that TIM-1 binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the OMV surface via its known phosphatidylserine-binding domain. Uptake of OMVs by TIM-1 triggers proinflammatory cytokine production which can be reduced by preventing this interaction. Additionally, OMVs from multiple bacterial species hijack TIM-1 for entry, making it an intriguing antivirulence strategy. Our findings establish TIM-1 as a critical host receptor mediating OMV uptake and provide a novel approach to modulate vesicle-driven pathogenesis and enhance OMV-based therapies."

We established and validated a physiologically relevant in vitro human placental co-culture barrier model using BeWo trophoblasts and primary human placental vascular endothelial cells (HPVECs), which exhibited robust barrier integrity and organized tight junctions. Using this model, we demonstrate that Lm exploits a Trojan-horse transmigration mechanism via infected monocytes. Lm-infected THP-1 monocytes displayed a ~4.8-fold higher monocyte transmigration and ~8.12-fold greater intracellular bacterial delivery across the placental barrier compared with non-pathogenic Listeria innocua (Li). Monocyte transmigration was associated with claudin-1 and occludin disruption, increased paracellular permeability, and localization of infected monocytes at junctional breach sites. Monocyte-mediated placental traversal required the Lm virulence factors Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) and internalin B (InlB), as lap- and {Delta}inlB mutants exhibited Li-like transmigration and an ~90% reduction in intracellular bacterial delivery, despite normal monocyte uptake. Lm-infected monocytes induced a ~1.86-fold increase in sVCAM-1 secretion, which was LAP- and InlB-dependent, consistent with pro-transmigration endothelial phenotype. In contrast, extracellular traversal required LAP and internalin A (InlA), as lap- and {Delta}inlA mutants exhibited severe defects comparable to Li, whereas {Delta}inlB and {Delta}hly were minimally impaired. Exposure of monocytes to extracellular Lm further amplified transmigration and barrier permeability. Together, these data define two distinct placental invasion routes: a monocyte-associated LAP/InlB-dependent pathway and an extracellular LAP/InlA-dependent pathway, identifying LAP as a critical noncanonical virulence factor in placental infection and mechanisms of vertical transmission."

However, the specific spatiotemporal patterns in airborne fungal assemblages often remain unquantified. This knowledge gap is particularly notable for allergenic fungi, despite the relevance of airborne fungal allergen exposures to public health. To better understand how airborne fungi, including known allergens, vary across broad spatial and temporal scales, we leveraged a pre-existing air sampling network to obtain bioaerosol samples from 7 national parks representing diverse biome types across the United States, with samples collected from each site every three days over an entire calendar year. We used marker gene DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR to characterize fungal assemblage composition and concentrations, including the concentrations of ten known allergenic genera. As expected, the composition of the airborne fungal assemblages, including the amounts and types of known allergens, varied across biomes. We also observed substantial temporal variation in the total amounts and types of fungi detected, particularly at higher latitude sites. While some of the temporal variation in allergen abundances followed seasonal patterns, we detected pronounced daily and weekly fluctuations in taxon-specific allergen abundances, with higher wind speeds generally associated with higher fungal allergen concentrations. Together, these results expand our understanding of fungal aerobiology across natural ecosystems and demonstrate how combining extensive air-sampling efforts with DNA-based analyses can improve assessments of public health risks associated with exposure to allergenic fungi in outdoor air."

    "content": "Laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) are commonly used to study and optimise anaerobic digestion (AD), yet the time required for such systems to become representative of full-scale processes remains unclear. This study investigated start-up and stabilisation dynamics in five parallel 10-L CSTRs operated as direct scale-downs of a full-scale agricultural biogas plant, using identical inoculum, substrate composition, organic loading rate (2.57 g VS/ L day), hydraulic retention time (55 days), and temperature (37 C). The reactors were monitored for 213 days (3.9 HRTs), with one reactor operated for an additional 330 days. All reactors showed highly reproducible behaviour but experienced a transient disturbance, characterised by volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation and fluctuating methane production after approximately one HRT. This disturbance was likely caused by a higher effective daily organic loading rate compared to full scale, resulting from once-daily feeding excluding weekends. Increasing the feeding frequency led to VFA degradation and recovery, and stable process performance was achieved after approximately three HRTs, with methane yields of 285 NL CH4/kg VS. The microbial community showed pronounced dynamics during start-up, including major genus-level shifts within Cloacimonadia and a transition in aceticlastic methanogens from Methanothrix to Methanosarcina compared to the full-scale system. Although microbial composition stabilised after about three HRTs, it remained dynamic during prolonged operation and diverged from the original inoculum. These results demonstrate that even direct scale-down reactors require extended stabilisation and may develop microbial communities that differ from the full-scale process, raising questions about their representativeness."

    "content": "Chronic wound infections, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, affect 1-2% of the world's population and incur direct healthcare costs exceeding $300B per year. Bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics is typically determined by standard in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) using Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). However, the results from these assays often do not correlate with therapeutic outcomes, potentially because the test conditions do not reflect those at the infection site. We sought to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in simulated wound fluid (SWF), a medium resembling wound exudate, compared with MHB. We observed discordance in AST results for representative antibiotics across six of nine antibiotic classes tested in SWF compared with MHB against MRSA USA300. The antibiotic classes showing the most significant discordant AST results included tetracyclines, to which USA300 was more resistant (up to a 128-fold shift), and {beta}-lactams, to which MRSA was unexpectedly more sensitive (up to a 256-fold shift) when tested in SWF. Genome-wide assays and subsequent mechanistic characterizations revealed that the increased resistance to tetracyclines is mediated by MntC, an extracellular binding protein of a manganese ABC transporter system, whereas the drastic sensitization to {beta}-lactams was driven by cell envelope remodelling in SWF. Further, Galleria mellonella incision wound infection results matched the in vitro susceptibility phenotypes of the tetracycline doxycycline and the {beta}-lactam cefuroxime in SWF but not in MHB, suggesting that this host-mimetic medium is a better predictor of MRSA in vivo wound infection therapeutic outcomes. Together, this work addresses the relatively long-recognized shortcomings of the MHB-based standard AST by uncovering alterations in MRSA antibiotic susceptibility in wound exudate-like fluid relative to MHB. It uncovers potentially clinically relevant antibiotic response determinants, identifying MntC as a potential new target for adjuvant therapy. Our results may also guide improved antibiotic therapeutic choices for drug-resistant MRSA wound infections."

Cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, primarily caused by S. brasiliensis in South America and to a lesser extent by S. schenckii in Southeast Asia, is emerging as a significant public health concern, due its outbreak potential. Itraconazole is the first-choice drug for treatment of human and cats, but reduced susceptibility has been reported based on previously proposed epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs). To support resistance surveillance, we aimed to establish CLSI-endorsed ECVs for these clinically relevant Sporothrix species. A total of 3,588 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for seven antifungal agents (amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, isavuconazole, olorofim, and terbinafine) were obtained from 19 international laboratories. Four of seven antifungals met the CLSI M57 guidelines criteria to determine the ECV. Established ECVs for amphotericin B were found to be high with 8 g/mL for S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, and 4 g/mL for S. schenckii. Itraconazole ECVs were 4 g/mL for S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Posaconazole ECVs were 4 g/mL for all three species (tentative for S. globosa), while the terbinafine ECV for S. brasiliensis was 0.12 g/mL. Olorofim demonstrated good in vitro activity, particularly against S. brasiliensis. Overall, this study establishes validated ECVs for key antifungals against Sporothrix species and identifies a low prevalence of non-wild type (NWT) isolates, supporting ongoing antifungal resistance monitoring."

    "content": "Chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major driver of airway inflammation, which plays a central role in the progression of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. During long-term colonization, P. aeruginosa adapts to the CF lung by downregulating virulence factors and adopting a biofilm-associated, mucoid lifestyle. Despite the expected reduction in immune activation due to these adaptations, excessive inflammation persists, a paradox that remains poorly understood. Our objective was to identify novel bacterial mediators sustaining persistent inflammation by P. aeruginosa in the CF lung. To this end, we analyzed clinical P. aeruginosa CF isolates, cultured them in synthetic CF sputum medium, and exposed 3D lung epithelial cell cultures to the resulting cell-free supernatants. There was considerable variability in pro-inflammatory activity among the isolates, with a subset of the isolates inducing strong IL-8 secretion by the 3D cells despite low production of known virulence factors. Comparative proteomics analysis of the cell-free supernatants of pro- and anti-inflammatory isolates revealed several mediators not previously linked to inflammation. Thirteen of these candidate pro-inflammatory mediators were selected for further analysis. Using P. aeruginosa transposon mutants lacking the respective mediators, DksA (a transcription factor) was confirmed as an immunomodulatory mediator in the 3D lung model. Finally, analysis of existing transcriptomes of P. aeruginosa in CF sputum, revealed that dksA was found to be one of the most strongly expressed genes in this patient population, highlighting the relevance of our findings. In conclusion, we identified a novel P. aeruginosa mediator that may contribute to CF airway inflammation."

    "content": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance demands new antibiotics, but conventional screening in nutrient-rich media often fails to predict in vivo efficacy, especially against Gram-negative bacteria. Minor groove binders (MGB), such as MGB-BP-3, are a promising new antibacterial with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria but thought to have limited potency against Gram-negative bacteria. Objectives: This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of MGB-BP-3 under nutrient-limited, physiologically relevant conditions to better mimic in vivo environments. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against a panel of ESKAPEE pathogens in both rich (Cation Adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth, CA-MHB) and nutrient-limited media (Roswell Park Memorial Institute, RPMI-1640 + 10% Luria-Bertani, LB). Synergy with efflux pump inhibitors and membrane permeabilizers was evaluated via checkerboard assays. Permeability was assessed using a fluorescent DNA-binding cell permeant (Hoechst 33342) accumulation assay. MICs were determined in the presence of different concentrations of ions, using both wild-type and efflux-compromised strains. In vivo efficacy was assessed using the Galleria mellonella infection model. Results: The activity of MGB-BP-3 against Gram-negative bacteria was improved by shifting the medium from rich to nutrient-limited conditions. Specifically, it showed potent activity against E. coli in nutrient-limited media (MIC 3.1 M) but was inactive in rich media (MIC 700 M). Synergy with efflux inhibitors occurred mainly in rich media, indicating barriers to intracellular accumulation were not present in nutrient-limited conditions. Increased permeability correlated with enhanced susceptibility and efflux-deficient strains were more susceptible, confirming the role of efflux pumps in resistance. MGB-BP-3 provided dose-dependent protection in G. mellonella larvae infected with E. coli or S. aureus. For example, at concentrations of 12.5 M and 100 M, MGB-BP-3 was able to protect the larvae by more than 70% over 5 days of treatment, respectively. Conclusions: Nutrient-limited media better reveal MGB-BP-3's activity against Gram-negative bacteria and align with in vivo efficacy, highlighting the need for host-mimicking conditions in antibiotic screening."

Trade-offs between performance under normal and challenging conditions may generate variation in stress coping capacity, but there is little empirical data from wild populations. We studied robustness and resilience to temperature in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) using a 39-year dataset that included >75,000 hours of behavioral data. Cold snaps had profound and sustained impacts on fitness; effects on nestlings were mediated by the behavioral robustness and resilience of parents. Parental robustness was predicted by developmental cold exposure and current endocrine state. As expected, trade-offs between peak performance and behavioral robustness influenced susceptibility. Selection on trade-offs may generate population differences in vulnerability to changing temperature regimes."

    "content": "The non-native larval parasitoid wasps Leptopilina japonica and Ganaspis kimorum (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), which attack larvae of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), were unintentionally introduced to the Pacific Northwest of North America between 10 and 15 years ago, and are now well-established. Previous laboratory studies conducted to assess the ecological risk of classical biological control introductions suggested that G. kimorum is highly host-specific, whereas L. japonica can develop in several other drosophilid species. Information on realized host use of the parasitoids under field conditions in the context of host-parasitoid food webs in their non-native range is limited. A two-year field study in coastal British Columbia, Canada was conducted, using complementary sampling methods to document host-parasitoid associations and quantify parasitoid specificity with respect to drosophilid communities inhabiting ripe and rotting fruit. Consistent with previous laboratory findings, G. kimorum was reared exclusively from D. suzukii, while L. japonica emerged primarily from D. suzukii but also from D. melanogaster and, less frequently, from members of the D. obscura species group. Leptopilina japonica shared some host species with the resident parasitoid species L. heterotoma and Asobara cf. rufescens. A particularly striking result was the extent to which almost all drosophilid and parasitoid taxa in this study's host-parasitoid trophic webs were non-native, complicating the interpretation of non-target ecological effects of L. japonica. These results provide field-based evidence of realized host use by these two non-native larval parasitoids of D. suzukii that can inform their future use in classical and augmentative biological control programs."

    "content": "Invasive species can cause maladaptive behaviours in native consumers, with evolution of behavioural or physiological traits thought to be the main way out of these so-called 'evolutionary traps'. However, shorter-term ecological processes resulting from biological invasions could provide other ways to escape evolutionary traps. Asobara cf. rufescens, a resident (i.e., possibly native or previously introduced) parasitoid of drosophilid fly larvae in North America, can rarely produce offspring on the invasive fruit pest Drosophila suzukii in the laboratory, but in often emerges from field-collected D. suzukii. We hypothesized that the successful development of A. cf. rufescens in D. suzukii in the field is facilitated by Leptopilina japonica, a recently introduced parasitoid of D. suzukii. In laboratory experiments, we found that A. cf. rufescens had more than 30-fold higher offspring emergence from D. suzukii when L. japonica was also present. This facilitation occurred most frequently when A. cf. rufescens parasitized D. suzukii after L. japonica, possibly because parasitism by L. japonica destroyed the hosts' cellular immunity that would otherwise prevent A. cf. rufescens development. The recent arrival of L. japonica may have partially rescued A. cf. rufescens from the evolutionary trap set by D. suzukii and, consequently, resulted in an expansion of its host range."

    "content": "Competition is generally considered a negative interaction that lowers the fitness of individuals. Studies of competition and fitness traits in parasitoids have primarily focused on interference competition, with less attention paid to parasitoids under exploitative competition. Theoretical studies predict that interference competition will decrease the resource utilisation of parasitoids, while exploitative competition will not. In our study, we investigated the impact of intraspecific exploitative competition among parasitoids on fitness traits, including resource utilisation, the percentage of offspring that emerged from parasitised eggs, and the percentage of female offspring produced from parasitised eggs. We investigated whether these fitness traits were influenced by the presence of conspecific foraging females, as well as by parasitoid and resource densities. Since we were studying the effect of exploitative competition, we used Trichogramma chilonis, a non-aggressive egg parasitoid. Corcyra cephalonica, a stored grain pest, was used as the host. We found that T. chilonis resource utilisation increased in the presence of conspecifics. However, the density of those conspecifics and the resource density did not affect resource utilisation. The presence of conspecific foraging females did not affect the rate of offspring survival. However, at a lower resource density, offspring survival was higher than under resource-abundant conditions. We explored this counterintuitive pattern using a simple mathematical model, which shows that superparasitism, occurring at high parasitoid density, can lead to high emergence. This is because, given only some progeny survive, the chance of parasitoid emergence increases with the number of eggs laid in the host. The secondary sex ratio of the progeny was unaffected by the presence of conspecifics or by parasitoid or resource densities. We conclude that for T. chilonis, the presence of competitors has a positive effect. Its high performance under competitive conditions may contribute to its efficiency as a biological control agent."

    "content": "Although fluctuating conditions are a hallmark of microbial habitats, how the timing of chemical stress influences single-cell inhibition and recovery is not well resolved. Using a microfluidic platform, we continuously tracked photosynthetic performance in thousands of individual cells of a coral-associated microalga (Symbiodiniaceae sp.) exposed to identical cumulative doses of the photosystem II inhibitor diuron delivered either as constant or fluctuating profiles. Fluctuating exposure produced stronger early inhibition than constant exposure, but as concentrations declined it enabled partial recovery that did not occur under time-averaged constant conditions. These dynamics revealed distinct response subpopulations that differed in both the magnitude and timing of inhibition, including groups that regained activity exclusively under fluctuating stress. Quantifying per-cell decline kinetics showed that fluctuating exposure synchronizes the onset of inhibition across cells, creating a narrow temporal window in which a subset of cells can recover once stress levels fall, whereas constant exposure yields more heterogeneous but uniformly declining trajectories. These results demonstrate that stress timing, not cumulative dose alone, governs whether photosynthetic inhibition is reversible at the single-cell level. More broadly, our findings illustrate how temporal variability and intrinsic phenotypic heterogeneity jointly govern cellular function, highlighting stress timing as an important and often overlooked axis shaping microbial performance in dynamic environments."

    "content": "Background: Malaria remains a major public health challenge in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To address the lack of contemporary entomological data, particularly in Kinshasa Province, this four-year study characterized key entomological parameters, including mosquito species composition, abundance, biting behavior, and insecticide resistance. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study (2018-2022) in three health areas representing rural, peri-urban, and urban settings in Kinshasa Province. Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled using CDC miniature light traps and pyrethrum spray catches. Insecticide susceptibility of adult females was assessed using WHO tube tests, and a generalized estimating equations model evaluated the effects of year, season, site, sampling location, and collection time on mosquito abundance. Results: A total of 1,449 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected: 50% in the rural health area of Bu, 49% in peri-urban Kimpoko, and 1% in urban La Voix du Peuple. The species captured were An. gambiae s.l. (85%), An. paludis (11%), and An. funestus (4%). An. gambiae s.l. was significantly more abundant indoors and after 10 PM. The overall entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was 4.6 infective bites per person per year, with An. gambiae s.l. contributing the highest rate. An. paludis showed a localized transmission peak in Impuru during the rainy season (EIR = 8.87). Resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was widespread, with an estimated 0.94 frequency of the kdr L1014F mutation. Bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl remained effective. Conclusions: This study confirms that An. gambiae s.l. remains the predominant malaria vector and plays a central role in transmission in Kinshasa. However, an emerging role of An. paludis in rural settings was observed. These findings underscore the need for vector control strategies tailored to diverse ecological settings. Continued entomological surveillance will be essential to track biting behavior and resistance patterns and ensure that interventions remain effective over time."

    "content": "Non-native predators profoundly restructure island biological communities worldwide, yet their management is hindered by limited empirical understanding of the dynamics of predator spread and prey extirpation. Here, we integrate two decades of field surveys, citizen-science records, and standardized transects to reconstruct the invasion of the snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis on Ibiza and its impact on the endangered, endemic lizard Podarcis pityusensis. We found a marked acceleration in range expansion despite intensified culling, evidence for the transition from establishment to spread stages of this invasion. Spatially explicit invasion maps combined with citizen reports of lizard disappearance show a non-linear acceleration in the interval from predator arrival to local prey extirpation, shortening from over ten years in early-invaded areas to three years in recently invaded areas. The observed patterns are consistent with density-dependent predator pressure, which generates a wave-like, rapidly advancing invasion front evidenced by declining snake body condition and reduced efficiency of snake captures in long-invaded areas. Our study empirically confirms theoretical predictions of nonlinear spread and impact dynamics and highlights how citizen science can crucially help documenting early invasion stages. Effectively incorporating the non-linear dynamics of invasions into conservation strategies is urgent to mitigate invasion-driven transformations of fragile island ecosystems worldwide."

    "content": "Pathogen-pathogen interactions occur when infection with one pathogen influences ones chance of infection or disease due to another. Increasingly, evidence suggests that interactions are a common feature of infectious disease epidemiology. However, due to both the nonlinearities and stochasticity inherent to infectious disease transmission, and the frequency of confounding (e.g., by shared seasonal forcing), purely statistical methods for characterizing interactions may be prone to failure. Here, we perform a simulation study to evaluate several non-mechanistic approaches for inferring causality from time series data: generalized additive models (GAMs), Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent cross-mapping (CCM). Specifically, we use a two-pathogen mechanistic transmission model, calibrated to produce dynamics resembling outbreaks of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to generate synthetic datasets with a range of values for interaction strength and duration. We then apply each method to all synthetic datasets. We find that Granger causality, transfer entropy, and CCM all fail to consistently infer whether data contain signal of an interaction; in particular, methods tend to incorrectly identify interactions where none are modeled (average sensitivity = 80.6%, 92.1%, 72.1%, respectively; average specificity = 31.0%, 33.3%, 33.1%). Furthermore, we find little to no association between point estimates from each method and true interaction strength. In contrast, GAMs infer the existence of interactions more accurately than the other methods (sensitivity = 85.2%, specificity = 72.5%), and consistently yield larger point estimates for stronger interactions. However, their practical utility is limited by an inability to evaluate interaction asymmetry (i.e., whether the effect of pathogen A on pathogen B is identical to that of B on A). We conclude that accurately and comprehensively characterizing pathogen-pathogen interactions based on outbreak data remains a significant challenge. For this reason, it is critical that any proposed methods be rigorously evaluated before being used to draw conclusions about interactions."
