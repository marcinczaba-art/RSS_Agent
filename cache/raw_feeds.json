    "content": "Abstract\nThe ocean plays a major role in controlling atmospheric carbon at decadal to millennial timescales, with benthic carbon representing the only geologic\u2010scale storage of oceanic carbon. Despite its importance, detailed benthic ocean observations are limited and representation of the benthic carbon cycle in ocean and Earth system models (ESMs) is mostly empirical with little prognostic capacity, which hinders our ability to properly understand the long\u2010term evolution of the carbon cycle and climate change\u2010related feedbacks. The Benthic Ecosystem and Carbon Synthesis (BECS) working group, with the support of the US Ocean Carbon & Biogeochemistry Program (OCB), identified key challenges limiting our understanding of benthic systems, opportunities to act on these challenges, and pathways to increase the representation of these systems in global modeling and observational efforts. We propose a set of priorities to advance mechanistic understanding and better quantify the importance of the benthos: (a) implementing a model intercomparison exercise with existing benthic models to support future model development, (b) data synthesis to inform both model parameterizations and future observations, (c) increased deployment of platforms and technologies in support of in situ benthic monitoring (e.g., from benchtop to field mesocosm), and (d) global coordination of a benthic observing program (\u201cGEOSed\u201d) to fill large regional data gaps and evaluate the mechanistic understanding of benthic processes acquired throughout the previous steps. Addressing these priorities will help inform solutions to both global and regional resource management and climate adaptation strategies."

(B) CCA act as sources of bacterial taxa that can establish and persist in adult E. singularis holobionts, independently of climate change effects.\n\nABSTRACT\nCrustose coralline algae (CCA) and their bacterial communities can emit chemical cues favoring coral larval settlement. Indeed, larvae of Eunicella singularis (white gorgonian) preferentially settle on CCA. Here, we investigated the effect of two Mediterranean CCA holobionts, Macroblastum dendrospermum and Lithophyllum stictiforme, on E. singularis larvae settlement and their bacterial communities, after warming and acidification treatments. We exposed CCA to temperature and pH expected for 2100 (SSP5\u20108.5) and to a marine heatwave event. Larval settlement increased 1.8\u20132.7 times in the presence of CCA exposed to warming and acidification compared to non\u2010exposed CCA. High abundance of bacteria belonging to the Pirellulaceae family was observed in all CCA, while a higher abundance of monosaccharides was found in exudates of exposed CCA. Based on CCA\u2010related 16S rDNA metabarcoding and metabolomics results, we hypothesize that the enhanced larval settlement was driven by the Pirellulaceae breakdown and utilization of CCA polysaccharides, in combination with polysaccharide release through the CCA cell walls likely augmented by decalcification. Furthermore, CCA acted as sources of bacterial taxa that may establish and persist in the adult E. singularis holobiont, independently of climate change effects. We conclude that CCA are key for E. singularis recruitment success, especially under future climate conditions, and contribute to their microbiome development."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Tibetan Plateau, known as the Third Pole, is experiencing rapid warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which profoundly influences the growth of crops such as highland barley. However, it remains unclear how highland barley photosynthesis quantitatively responds to changes in CO2 concentration and how the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship responds to warming on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we examined the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship of highland barley leaves at the heading stage and its developmental response to experimental warming (+1 and +2\u00b0C). The photosynthetic CO2 saturation concentration (Ca,sat) of highland barley leaves was 1,208.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0533.4\u00a0ppm, exceeding the current atmospheric CO2 concentration (419.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0ppm in 2022, Waliguan). Experimental warming did not significantly affect the maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax, 39.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 s\u22121), Ca,sat (1,208.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0533.4\u00a0ppm), the CO2 compensation concentration (Ca,com, 58.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.8\u00a0ppm), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax, 142.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121), and the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax, 193.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.0\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121) at a measurement temperature of 25\u00b0C. At +2\u00b0C warming, the carotenoid content of highland barley leaves increased by 5%\u201321%, whereas chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents were not significantly affected. Our findings highlight that the CO2 fertilization effect on highland barley leaf photosynthesis is expected to continue and experimental warming may developmentally influence highland barley leaf photosynthesis by altering the leaf carotenoid content rather than the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship."

Although Arctic warming and sea ice retreat have been well\u2010documented, the influence of tropical Atlantic SST on Arctic sea ice remains understudied. Using reanalysis data sets and model simulations, we demonstrate that tropical Atlantic warming significantly reduces Beaufort Sea SIC. This warming triggers a Rossby wave train that propagates northeastward, altering the high\u2010latitude atmospheric circulation and inducing southerly flow anomalies. These anomalies enhance moisture transport, increase cloud cover, and amplify downward longwave radiation accelerating sea ice melt. Our findings, supported by Community Atmosphere Model version 5 and Community Earth System Model simulations, highlight the crucial role of tropical\u2010Arctic teleconnections in Arctic sea ice variability."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nUnderstanding how dispersal impacts the genetic makeup of populations is essential for predicting their responses to environmental change. Gene flow\u2014via within\u2010population dispersal and external immigration\u2014shapes population health and evolutionary potential by boosting genetic diversity, but it can also counteract local adaptation. We investigate these processes in a population of great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, United Kingdom. This system represents a large, continuous population of a vagile, widely distributed species. Using a comprehensive social pedigree alongside two genomic datasets, one with 949 individuals genotyped at 600,000 SNPs and another with 2644 individuals typed at 10,000 SNPs, we demonstrate spatial genetic structure largely driven by the spatial and temporal clustering of close kin. We quantify how temporally persistent this pattern is and find that relatedness declines with geographic distance in a consistent manner across years, without a consistent genetic basis, a pattern which is frequently renewed due to high population turnover. Immigrants make up a substantial portion of the breeding population, yet are often assumed to be genetically distinct, unrelated and outbred\u2014assumptions that can bias population inferences. We show that immigrants are indeed outbred, as are local birds; have fewer close relatives within the population, and are less likely to be related to their neighbours than locally born birds. Despite low FST and no clear genome\u2010wide population structure, immigrants and locals can be distinguished above chance using a Random Forest classifier trained on SNP data. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dispersal, population turnover and spatial population structure, and suggests that great tits in Wytham Woods experience substantial gene flow within the population and from immigrants, maintaining high genetic diversity and reducing the possibility of local adaptation at this spatial scale."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nSalinity\u2014an essential factor shaping marine species distributions\u2014is rapidly shifting due to global change, yet the mechanisms of salinity tolerance and adaptation remain poorly understood. We investigated local adaptation in the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa, a broadly distributed marine species that thrives in the brackish Baltic Sea. Using a common\u2010garden design, we compared physiological and transcriptomic responses to low salinity between populations from the North Sea (>\u200925 PSU) and the Baltic Sea (<\u200915 PSU). Baltic copepods exhibited significantly higher survival under low salinity, indicating local adaptation. While both populations shared a core osmoregulatory strategy involving active ion transport and regulation of amino acids, transcriptomic profiles revealed population\u2010specific differences. Baltic individuals showed a reduced overall gene expression response, yet maintained higher relative expression of osmoregulatory genes\u2014suggesting a more efficient and primed transcriptomic response. In contrast, North Sea copepods exhibited broader transcriptional shifts, including downregulation of metabolic and developmental pathways after prolonged stress exposure, possibly reflecting energy conservation mechanisms. These findings reveal that A. tonsa possesses both a plastic osmoregulatory strategy and population\u2010level adaptation that enable survival in extreme salinity conditions. While both populations tolerate short\u2010term exposure to low salinity, local adaptation has enhanced the Baltic population's resilience. This suggests that A. tonsa is broadly tolerant of moderate climate\u2010driven salinity declines across most of its distribution. However, our data also indicate potential range contractions in the lowest salinity zones of the Baltic Sea, underscoring the importance of identifying physiological and genetic thresholds in climate resilience studies."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe heavy reliance on pyrethroid\u2010based interventions has largely driven insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, accelerating the spread of resistant strains, including resistant Anopheles funestus strains. The efficacy of insecticide\u2010based interventions, especially insecticide\u2010treated nets (ITNs), the cornerstone of malaria control and management, is threatened by the widespread occurrence of resistance, jeopardising malaria control efforts. Alpha\u2010cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid, is increasingly utilised in various ITN formulations, including those combined with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and chlorfenapyr\u2010based Interceptor G2 (IG2) nets, to enhance effectiveness against resistant mosquito populations. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of resistance is essential to monitor and track resistance trends for an effective malaria control program. In this study, we identified a 1.4\u2009Mb QTL on the telomeric end of the left arm of chromosome 2, conferring resistance to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin (rap1 QTL). Different crossing schemes and sequencing approaches were explored to determine the most effective strategy. Individual\u2010based QTL mapping performed on segregating individuals from an isofemale family identified a QTL at the F7 generation. Higher recombination density relative to the physical genome in the F7 isofemale family, with a recombination every 240\u2009kb, facilitated the detection of a QTL compared to the F2 family (335\u2009kb/cM). Additionally, we exploited bulk segregant analysis (BSA) between susceptible and resistant phenotypes from the F7 isofemale family and an F7 mixed cross\u2010family to perform cost\u2010effective and rapid QTL\u2010mapping discovery. The strongest signal in both independent BSA analyses overlaps with the rap1 QTL, further supporting its role in \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin resistance. The known resistant alleles of the cytochrome P450 CYP6P9a and 6.5\u2010kb structural variant within the rap1 QTL strongly correlate with survival to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin. In this study, we validated that previously developed DNA\u2010based assays, originally designed to monitor permethrin resistance, are effective for tracking resistance to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin as well. Additionally, we identified candidate variants that can serve as reliable markers for monitoring \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin resistance."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nAquatic insects are the most biodiverse freshwater animals. DNA metabarcoding data are increasingly used to assess variation in insect communities, but they are rarely integrated with information on the abundance or biomass of different taxa that can provide key insights into their functional responses. Here, we combined organismal metabarcoding and biomass estimates of different clades of aquatic insects to assess how different facets of their biodiversity (taxonomic and functional diversity; species traits) are affected by multiple stressors, including invasive species, drought and variation in vegetation. In 44 waterbodies in Northern Italy, we measured environmental features (e.g., pond surface, hydroperiod, and the presence of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and collected insect specimens. Specimens were weighed and then used for DNA metabarcoding. The relationship between biomass of seven insect orders and their relative abundance in metabarcoding data was used to obtain quantitative estimates of taxa biomasses across communities and to extract multiple diversity measures. Different facets of biodiversity showed distinct responses to the environmental stressors. The taxonomic diversity of insect communities strongly responded to aquatic vegetation, while functional diversity was more sensitive to the invasive crayfish. Total insect biomass was negatively related to fish presence, but insects with different functional traits showed specific responses to environmental features. Our results show that integrating metabarcoding data with biomass estimates can improve our understanding of community responses to multiple stressors and highlight the importance of considering multiple measures of diversity to get a comprehensive assessment of aquatic insects' responses to environmental variation."

However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In this study, we employed a data-driven approach to analyze recurrent functional connectivity patterns in resting-state fMRI data and developed a parameterized feedback inhibition model to characterize excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. The findings demonstrate that LSD enhances global brain synchrony and dynamic complexity. This enhanced synchrony likely stems from LSD\u2019s preferential stabilization of a globally synchronized yet functionally non-modular brain state - a pattern showing higher occurrence probability and acts as an \u201cattractor\u201d that recruits transitions from cognitive control networks. Crucially, these phenomena appear underpinned by LSD-induced convergence of excitatory/inhibitory balance across cortical hierarchies, particularly through Sensorimotor (SOM) suppression coupled with transmodal potentiation, where the Sensorimotor cortices emerge as potential regulatory hubs driving this neurochemical rebalancing. These convergent effects are consistent with the emergence of a brain state characterized by weakened sensory anchoring and enhanced cognitive flexibility, where the typical separation between concrete perception and abstract cognition becomes blurred. This neurophysiological remodeling therefore suggests a potential mechanism that could contribute to LSD\u2019s hallucinatory effects and its therapeutic potential in mental disorders characterized by rigid thought patterns."

Recent deep learning models have started to combine different types of cellular information, such as spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, ligand\u2013receptor signaling, and in some cases, gene regulatory networks. However, they often treat a cell\u2019s external interactions and internal gene regulation separately, merging them at the final step using simple concatenation or addition. This limits the model\u2019s ability to capture how cell\u2013cell communication and internal molecular states are connected. In this paper, we present MAGNET (Multi-view Graph Autoencoder with Cell-Gene Attention Network), a framework that reconstructs cell\u2013cell interaction networks by building multiple biological graphs and developing a Cell-Gene attention module to link a cell\u2019s environment with its internal gene activity in a unified representation. On benchmark datasets (seqFISH, MERFISH, STARMAP), MAGNET demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing cell-cell interaction networks, achieving an Average Precision(AP) of 0.901 on the seqFISH dataset and outperforming TENET by 0.185. The Cell-Gene Attention module is critical to MAGNET\u2019s performance, as its removal alone caused the AP on the seqFISH dataset to drop from 0.901 to 0.521. Applied to a breast cancer dataset, MAGNET found functional heterogeneity among cancer cells, distinguishing clusters with molecular signatures for either immune evasion or autonomous tumor growth."

In addition, we introduce a layout algorithm that aims to improve clarity by minimizing the total reticulate displacement of reticulate edges.

Kirk</p>\n\nThe subcellular localisation of proteins is a key determinant of their function. High-throughput analyses of these localisations can be performed using mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, which enables us to examine the localisation and relocalisation of proteins. Furthermore, complementary data sources can provide additional sources of functional or localisation information. Examples include protein annotations and other high-throughput \u2018omic assays. Integrating these modalities can provide new insights as well as additional confidence in results, but existing approaches for integrative analyses of spatial proteomics datasets, such as concatenation-based methods and transfer learning approaches like KNN-TL, are limited in the types of data they can integrate and do not quantify uncertainty in their predictions. Here we propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach (wherein model parameters are inferred from <i>both</i> labeled marker proteins and unlabeled data while quantifying prediction uncertainty) to integrate spatial proteomics datasets with other data sources, to improve the inference of protein sub-cellular localisation. We demonstrate our approach outperforms other transfer-learning methods and has greater flexibility in the data it can model - including categorical annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology terms), continuous measurements (e.g., protein abundance), and temporal profiles (e.g., time-series expression data). To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we apply our method to integrate spatial proteomics data generated for the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> with time-series gene expression data generated over its cell cycle. Our findings suggest that proteins linked to invasion organelles are associated with expression programs that peak at the end of the first cell-cycle. Furthermore, this integrative analysis divides the dense granule proteins into heterogeneous populations suggestive of potentially different functions. Our method is disseminated via the mdir R package available on the lead author\u2019s Github."

Einevoll</p>\n\nElectrical stimulation of nervous tissue is grounded in well-established biophysical principles, yet understanding its precise effect on neural activity remains challenging. This represents a major obstacle to both scientific and clinical applications of electrical brain stimulation.\nWe here show that the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism can be applied more broadly than previously acknowledged, providing a framework for elucidating the effects of electrical brain stimulation on neurons. Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation\u2013induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/<i>r</i> falloff for nearby and 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> falloff for distant neurons.\nWe also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.\nThe reciprocity-based approach to electrical stimulation reproduces a large body of previous experimental data, and provides new insights into how ES affects neurons."

    "content": "<p>by Nilapratim Sengupta, Jennifer I. Luebke, Christina M. Weaver</p>\n\nAction potentials (APs) propagate along axons to enable precise and rapid neuronal communication. Axon collaterals extend a given neuron\u2019s range by distributing signals to multiple targets, but also increase its electrical demands. Myelination facilitates saltatory conduction, dramatically enhancing transmission speed and ensuring conduction fidelity over long distances. The interplay between myelin dystrophy and axonal arborization remains largely unexplored, despite their role in the impairment of AP conduction in brain circuits. Here we used cohorts of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental models of rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) layer 3 pyramidal neurons to investigate how axon collateralization, myelin dystrophy, and other structural and biophysical perturbations affect AP conduction velocity (CV). We identified core diameter and branch point location, particularly its distance from the soma, as key structural determinants of CV. Under pathological conditions, branch points emerged as sites of heightened vulnerability, where even focal myelin damage markedly impaired conduction. The efficacy of remyelination to restore CV depended on the number of segments that replaced each demyelinated region. Effective length constant and focal input resistance largely predicted CV reductions caused by structural changes. In addition to demyelination, CV was highly sensitive to variations in axoplasmic and membrane resistivities, the formation of myelin balloons, and ion channel redistribution. These findings offer a mechanistic framework for understanding AP conduction in myelinated axons with complex topologies, while also pointing to potential factors underlying individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive impairments. This work thus provides an important building block for multiscale modeling of network and behavioral effects of aging, as well as axonopathies such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and traumatic brain injury."

    "content": "<p>by Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>\n\nShape perception is central to human vision, but its developmental origins remain unknown. Here we show that shape perception develops from three ingredients: (1) generic fitting systems, (2) embodied visual experiences, and (3) biologically plausible sensors. We first show that generic fitting models (transformers) trained on embodied visual experiences change from color-based to shape-based visual systems. We then perform <i>in silico</i> controlled-rearing experiments to determine what causes this developmental change. We find that view diversity\u2014experiencing many views of the same object\u2014produces shape perception. For embodied agents, view diversity comes for free: by moving through the world, agents acquire diverse temporally linked views, explaining how and why animals develop shape perception so rapidly. But when view diversity is restricted, by limiting where an agent can look or move, shape perception fails to develop. Finally, we show that retinas naturally transform images in ways that enhance shape learning, providing a biologically plausible substitute for artificial image augmentations. Together, our results support generic fitting theories of brain development and provide a template for building human-like shape perception in machines."

LCMSpector is a standalone graphical user interface application for straightforward analysis of targeted mass spectrometry data, distributed under the MIT license and available free of charge for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine by specifying the desired mass-to-charge ratios of the targeted compound ions and simply clicking \u201cProcess\u201d. It allows for the processing of multiple files simultaneously, freely modifying and exporting graphs in real time, and calculating compound concentrations based on calibration standards.

    "content": "<p>by Sol\u00e8ne Song, Paul Villoutreix</p>\n\nDevelopment is a complex process driven by coordinated cell proliferation, differentiation, and spatial organization. Classically, two ways to specify cell types during development have been hypothesized: the mosaic and regulative modes. In the mosaic mode, a particular cell isolated from the rest of the embryo will still give rise to progeny with the same fate as expected in normal development, relying on lineage-inherited factors. In contrast, in the regulative mode, the fate of a cell depends on its interactions with its environment and thus relies on space-dependent factors. While both modes often co-exist, their relative contributions remain poorly quantified at single-cell resolution. We present a novel approach to measure these contributions from single-cell data from <i>C. elegans</i> development. The invariant lineage of <i>C. elegans</i> allows the integration of spatial positions, lineage relationships, and protein expression data. Using single-cell protein expression profiles as a readout of cell state, we define two quantifiable metrics: 1) a proxy for the contribution of the mosaic mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell lineage distance and the cell-cell expression distance, 2) a proxy for the contribution of the regulative mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell context distance \u2013 capturing spatial neighborhood similarity - and the cell-cell expression distance. To validate these metrics, we compared empirical results from <i>C. elegans</i> to artificial models with defined developmental rules. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of mosaic and regulative modes, with their relative contributions varying across tissues and developmental stages. For example, in skin tissue, the mosaic mode dominates in early development, while the regulative mode prevails later. Our approach offers a quantitative, unbiased, and perturbation-free method to study fundamental principles of developmental biology."

    "content": "<p>by Sofia Radrizzani, Juan Rivas-Santisteban, Namshik Han, Laurence D. Hurst</p>\n\nDespite early assumptions of neutrality, numerous mechanisms are now thought to cause selection on synonymous mutations, commonly supported by a low evolutionary rate at synonymous sites (<i>K</i><sub>s</sub>). This has been best evidenced in the first ~10 codons of genes in <i>E. coli,</i> where <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is less than around half that of the gene body. Diverse lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these first ~10 codons are under selection for high AT content which causes low mRNA stability that in turn enables ribosomal initiation. There remains one enigmatic discrepancy, however, namely that the low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain extends far beyond the first 10 codons. Here we ask why this is. As we see no evidence that the zone influencing protein levels has been misestimated, we consider three further hypotheses: that reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is a) owing to overlapping genes, b) reflects an extended slow translational \u201cramp,\u201d and c) is mutational. We reject the first two as in both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus sp.</i> the extended low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain persists on analysis of non-overlapping genes and in <i>Bacillus</i>, where fast optimal codons tend to be A/T-ending, a fast-to-slow codon trend is seen. We fail to falsify the third hypothesis. Employing mutation accumulation data for <i>E. coli</i> we show that the 5\u2032 end has a lower mutation rate, with the first 10 codons having a rate around half that of the gene body, this then steadily increasing following the trend seen for <i>K</i><sub>s</sub>. Compositional variation is likely to explain some of the difference, the 5\u2032 end lacking GC-rich runs while these are most mutagenic. We conclude that even a highly reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is not always adequate to substantiate selection on synonymous mutations. This result has broad implications for inference of the causes of evolutionary rate variation."

    "content": "<p>by Ya-Wen Hsueh, Po-Min Chiang</p>\n\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) requires high sensitivity, throughput, and broad compatibility across specimens. Current high-capacity methods lack sensitivity compared to low-capacity counterparts. Moreover, tissue-specific methods for collecting cells/nuclei limit unbiased comparisons across samples. Here, we propose a Unified framework by Split-Pool barcoding with optimal-efficiency PolydeoxyAdenylation for scRNA detection (USPPAR). Using short and long dsDNA substrates, low Co\u00b2\u207a\u2009concentration, while eliminating all other metal-ion components, enabled terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to efficiently polydeoxyadenylate intractable blunt and 3\u2032 recessed dsDNA ends, which was unattainable with other systems. By benchmarking against six state-of-the-art technologies using HEK293, the efficient addition of PCR handles for cDNA amplification made USPPAR\u2019s gene detection sensitivity comparable to high-sensitivity methods and significantly higher than existing high-cell-capacity platforms. In primary PBMCs, USPPAR enabled high-sensitivity, high-resolution scRNA-seq, and lysine conjugation improved sensitivity as an RNase inactivator. Based on nuclease reporter and mRNA protection assays, partially chelated Cu\u00b2\u207a\u2009served as a potent, non-precipitating, broad-spectrum nuclease inhibitor across various pH levels. Beyond demonstrating high sensitivity in liver tissue, an organ with low nuclease activity, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with this inhibitor enabled one-pot extraction of RNA-stable nuclei from nuclease-rich tissues, such as the pancreas. Finally, comparisons with reference datasets from the 10\u00d7 platform using mouse spleen and maize tissues showed that USPPAR matched cell-type coverage while achieving higher gene-detection efficiency. With five key enzymes available and quality-controlled, USPPAR provides a unified, cost-effective, sensitive method for high-cell-capacity scRNA profiling of diverse specimens without special equipment."

    "content": "Memory reactivation renders consolidated memory fragile and thereby opens the window for memory updates, such as memory reconsolidation. However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory retrieval-extinction protocol prevents the return of fear expression shortly after extinction training, and this short-term effect is memory reactivation dependent (Study 1, <i>N</i>=57 adults). Furthermore, across different timescales, the memory retrieval-extinction paradigm triggers distinct types of fear amnesia in terms of cue specificity and cognitive control ability dependence, suggesting that the short-term fear amnesia might be caused by different mechanisms from the cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, <i>N</i>=79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, <i>N</i>=75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that both memory reactivation and intact prefrontal cortex function were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia after the retrieval-extinction protocol. The differences in temporal scale, cue specificity, and cognitive control ability dependence between the short- and long-term amnesia suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings suggest the potential involvement of coordinated memory modulation processes upon memory retrieval and may inform clinical approaches for treating persistent maladaptive memories."

    "content": "Forming new memories after a one-time experience requires initial encoding then consolidation over time. During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labeling 24 hr following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows us to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN\u2212 neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM\u2212 neurons. This suggests that CA3 PNs recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 PNs undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task."

Yet the quantitative rules linking single-cell decision-making to tissue-scale organization remain poorly resolved. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that defines an order parameter predicting when initially disordered colonies undergo a transition to ordered fate alignment and when minimal, localized inputs can redirect their collective state. This analysis reveals a distinct control regime in which multicellular assemblies become susceptible to a single engineered guide cell. We validate these predictions by introducing guide cells that integrate into unperturbed colonies and redirect fate patterns within the theoretically defined control windows. Together, these results connect single-cell decision rules to emergent tissue-level organization and establish a generalizable biological control strategy in which a minority engineered subset can reliably redirect the developmental trajectory of a much larger multicellular population."

The results revealed a high concordance between metagenomic and Sanger sequencing for species identification (Kappa = 0.667, P = 0.011). Metagenomic analysis identified vector-specific dominant bacteria, including Wolbachia in mosquitoes, Blattabacterium sp. in cockroaches, Bartonella tribocorum and Leptospira interrogans in rodents, and Vagococcus teuberi in flies. It also detected numerous classical pathogens, such as Enterococcus faecalis, L. interrogans, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Among the identified fungi and viruses, 19 were human pathogens, while seven posed a threat to agriculture, notably Pepper mild mottle virus and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus. These findings systematically characterize the microbial communities associated with various vectors, highlight the potential of metagenomics for broad pathogen screening, and underscore its utility in large-scale vector surveillance and public health protection."

    "content": "Abstract\nDissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is the dominant form of bioavailable nitrogen in the euphotic zone of subtropical gyres, where nitrate (NO3\u2212) concentrations are low. However, identifying regions where DON consumption may support surface ocean productivity remains challenging due to the relatively narrow range in euphotic zone DON concentrations. The stable isotopic composition (\u03b415N) of DON has recently emerged as a sensitive tool for identifying regions of DON production and consumption in the surface ocean. Here, we report DON concentration and \u03b415N measurements in the upper \u223c300\u00a0m from a >10, 000\u00a0km zonal GO\u2010SHIP transect along \u223c30\u00b0S in the South Pacific (P06\u20102017 transect) from the Chilean to the Australian coasts. We observed higher upper 50\u00a0m DON concentrations in the east associated with DON production in regions with elevated primary productivity. Upper 50\u00a0m DON \u03b415N decreases from east to the west, coincident with a gradient in the \u03b415N of subsurface (i.e., 100\u2013200\u00a0m) NO3\u2212, consistent with subsurface NO3\u2212 fueling DON production. Further, both the partial and complete assimilation of surface NO3\u2212 observed along the transect are imprinted on the \u03b415N of surface DON. An inverse relationship between the concentration and \u03b415N of surface DON was found in the western portion of the transect, consistent with DON consumption by phytoplankton. Combining concentrations and \u03b415N of DON, we identified regions of DON production and consumption across the largest subtropical ocean gyre."

    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the oceanic Copper (Cu) budget is essential for tracing nutrient pathways, interpreting ancient sediment records, and assessing global environmental changes. However, the global oceanic Cu cycle remains imbalanced, largely due to insufficient studies on the flux and isotopic composition of authigenic Cu in oxic pelagic sediments. Here, we present the Cu isotopic compositions of pelagic sediments collected from the western (non\u2010hydrothermal area) and eastern South (hydrothermal area) Pacific Ocean. These results indicate that authigenic Cu in pelagic sediments is primarily hosted by iron\u2010manganese (oxyhydr)oxides. The isotopic composition of authigenic Cu in pelagic sediments (0.01\u2030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u2030, 2SD) is considerably lighter than the previously assumed value of \u223c0.3\u2030, which was based on the Cu isotopic compositions of iron\u2010manganese crusts and nodules. Using these new isotopic constraints, together with a newly calculated Cu flux to pelagic sediments of 15.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0mol\u00a0yr\u22121, we propose a new, balanced oceanic budget for Cu isotopes. This study precisely defines the flux and isotopic composition of the largest oceanic Cu sink, placing new constraints on the marine Cu cycle."

While 30% of carriage isolates could not be assigned a genogroup, all invasive isolates were successfully genogrouped. Genogroup B (MenB) predominated, representing 27% of carriage and 75% of IMD isolates.

    "content": "Abstract\nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, with river discharge as a major transport mechanism from land to ocean. As the second\u2010largest freshwater contributor to oceans, Asia experiences significant hydroclimatic variations, yet, observations are patchy across watersheds and climate zones. Here, we compiled 1,593 DOC observations from 40 studies spanning most Asian climate zones to map large\u2010scale patterns, and tested hydroclimatic controls for a set of representative watersheds (Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong, Ganges\u2010Brahmaputra, and Rajang) where sufficient time series records exist. Our findings show DOC concentrations peaking near the equator (tropical rainforest) and again above \u223c40\u00b0N (humid continental dry winter), with tributaries exhibiting higher and more variable levels than mainstems. Hydroclimatic responses were basin\u2010dependent: DOC\u2010precipitation correlation was not significant, yet DOC significantly differed across precipitation groups with highest means at low precipitation, indicating nonlinearity and likely thresholds; temperature effects diverged by basin; and soil moisture was a consistent positive driver, especially in Mekong and Yangtze. Overall, this study highlights that DOC behavior in Asia cannot be captured by uniform assumptions across basins and climate zones. As most existing observations are limited to short\u2010term data sets, the impacts of hydroclimatic change on carbon transport remain uncertain and require long\u2010term data sets. Future research should take an interdisciplinary approach by integrating hydrology, geomorphology, and climate indicators by fusing remote sensing based observations and advanced analytics, to address differences in DOC behavior and climate challenges."

    "content": "Abstract\nUtilizing 250\u2010m resolution sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) data from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite in combination with mooring measurements, this research investigates the three\u2010dimensional evolution of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in the northern South China Sea (nSCS). A novel inversion method based on the horizontal momentum equation was developed to retrieve ISW amplitudes from SSHA data, yielding a mean absolute deviation of 16% relative to mooring measurements. Application of this method to ISW SSHA (5\u201360\u00a0cm) in the nSCS revealed ISW amplitude distributions spanning 10\u2013250\u00a0m. A stratification\u2010modulated quasi\u2010linear correlation between amplitude and SSHA was identified in waters deeper than 1,000\u00a0m, with slope coefficients ranging from \u223c350 (July\u2013September) to \u223c530 (January\u2013March), enabling fast amplitude estimation from SWOT observations. SWOT's orbital configurations allow tracking of ISW evolution in the nSCS at daily intervals, revealing three key features of ISW evolution: (a) the total energy integrated along the ISW crest typically decreased, and the south\u2010strong\u2013north\u2010weak asymmetry of the ISW crest generally reversed during the basin\u2010to\u2010slope propagation; (b) in addition to distorting the wave crest, mesoscale eddies are linked to ISW amplitude increases of up to 34% in energy convergence portions and decreases of up to 49% in energy divergence portions; (c) oblique interactions between ISWs generated near the Batan and Babuyan Islands notably enhanced the ISW amplitude. This research underscores the potential of combining SWOT and mooring data to better monitor ISW structure and understand their interactions with mesoscale features."

    "content": "<p>by Chenhui Ma, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>\n\nUnderstanding how chemotherapy perturbs cell cycle dynamics is critical for advancing cancer treatment. We develop a probabilistic, multi-generational framework based on a Bellman\u2013Harris branching process to quantify treatment-induced shifts in tumor cell dynamics. The model incorporates key drug-responsive behaviors, including checkpoint activation, apoptosis, and checkpoint adaptation that propagates inherited DNA damage, enabling the characterization of heterogeneous survival outcomes after treatment. Biological parameters map directly onto DNA repair fidelity and cell-fate decisions, providing mechanistic insights beyond what is accessible from experiments alone. Dose-dependent extensions further allow exploration of treatment-induced perturbations. Model parameters were calibrated to empirical cell cycle measurements using the robust adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Global sensitivity analysis shows that scale parameters governing unfaithful DNA repair under G2/M- and S phase\u2013specific agents exert major influence on model predictions, particularly at later time points. Across three chemotherapies, the framework reveals consistent dose-dependent alterations in cell cycle dynamics, with higher doses driving pronounced disruptions. Together, these results demonstrate how model-informed analyses can provide quantitative insight into treatment-induced cell cycle perturbations and support the refinement of therapeutic strategies."

    "content": "<p>by Naoyuki Okamoto, Michael Taylor, Takatomi Kubo, Shin Ishii, Benedetto De Martino, Aurelio Cortese</p>\n\nMistakes are valuable learning opportunities, yet in uncertain environments, whether a lack of reward is due to poor performance or bad luck can be hard to tell. To investigate how humans address this issue, we developed a visuomotor task where rewards depended on either skill or chance. Participants consistently displayed a self-attribution bias, crediting successes to their own ability while blaming failures on randomness, an effect that influenced their subsequent decisions. Computational modelling revealed two underlying mechanisms\u2014a distorted perception of ability and a positivity bias in the skill condition. Notably, while distorted self-perception shaped behaviour, it did not affect confidence; instead, self-attribution bias led to overconfidence in external blame. These findings suggest a more complex picture in which self-attribution biases arise from both perceptual distortions and post-decision evaluations, highlighting the need for an interplay between experimental design and computational modelling to understand behavioural biases."

Recent work has suggested that one cause of this age difference in exploration is a reduction in the extent to which older adults use \u201crandom exploration\u201d \u2013 exploration driven by behavioral variability. Here we investigate potential mechanisms for this age-related difference in random exploration through the lens of a drift diffusion model (DDM) of the explore-exploit choice. In this model, random exploration can be modulated by two mechanisms \u2013 the fidelity with which information about the choice is represented in the brain, the \u201csignal-to-noise ratio\u201d (SNR), and the amount of information required to make a decision, the \u201cdecision threshold.\u201d Reduced random exploration in aging could be caused either by an increase in signal-to-noise ratio or an increase in decision threshold in older adults. By fitting the DDM to choices and response times in a sample of healthy younger and older adults, we found that older adults had a lower SNR and a higher threshold than younger adults. This suggests that reduced random exploration in aging is driven by higher response thresholds in older adults, which may compensate for the reduced signal-to-noise ratio with which decision information is represented in the brain."

However, from invertebrates to mammals, age-related decline is typically restricted to specific neuron types or brain parts, indicating differential vulnerability. The rules to pinpoint the susceptibility of distinct brain elements to aging remain largely unknown. Here, we combine longitudinal studies with neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and optophysiological analyses in the <i>Drosophila</i> genetic model to identify aging-susceptible and aging-resilient elements in a sensorimotor circuit that underlies escape. Young and mid-aged flies escape predator-like visual stimuli with a jump followed by flight, but behavioral performance declines with age. Mapping the underlying functional decline into the brain shows that most circuit components are robust against aging and remain functional even in old flies that have lost the behavior. By contrast, behavioral decline is caused by the selective decay of synaptic transmission between one specific visual projection neuron type (LC4) and the dendrite of one identified descending neuron (GF). Structurally, presynaptic active zone marker density is reduced whereas postsynaptic marker density remains normal. Other central synapses in this circuit as well as neuromuscular synapses are robust to aging. The synaptic connection susceptible to aging is also the circuit element most vulnerable to starvation or oxidative stress. Moreover, the vulnerable circuit element is also required for habituation, and thus, underlying circuit plasticity. In conjunction with data from mammalian brains our data suggest that a trade-off for functional neural circuit plasticity might be vulnerability to aging."

    "content": "<p>by Yanying Yu, Nicole E. Wheeler, Lars Barquist</p>\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to human health. Increasingly, genome sequencing is being applied for the surveillance of bacterial pathogens, producing a wealth of data to train machine learning (ML) applications to predict AMR and identify resistance determinants. However, bacterial populations are highly structured, and sampling is biased towards human disease isolates, violating ML assumptions of independence between samples. This is rarely considered in applications of ML to AMR. Here, we demonstrate the confounding effects of sample structure by analyzing over 24,000 whole genome sequences and AMR phenotypes from five diverse pathogens, using pathological training data where resistance is confounded with phylogeny. We show the resulting ML models perform poorly and that increasing the training sample size fails to rescue performance. A comprehensive analysis of 6,740 models identifies species- and drug-specific effects on model accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of current ML approaches in the face of realistic sampling biases and underscore the need for population structure-aware methods and more diverse datasets to improve AMR prediction and surveillance."

    "content": "<p>by Salsabil Arabi, Chaoqun Ni, B. Ian Hutchins</p>\n\nDuring career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals reject large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands, but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists\u2019 articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) they are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which, under journal-level evaluation regimes, may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work; however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10%\u201320% of this influential work."

    "content": "Neuronal function is intimately tied to axodendritic polarity. Neurotransmitter release, for example, is usually the role of the axon. There are widespread exceptions to this rule, however, including many mammalian neuronal types that can release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. In the mouse olfactory bulb, closely related subclasses of dopaminergic interneuron differ markedly in their polarity, with one subtype lacking an axon entirely. These axon-bearing and anaxonic dopaminergic subclasses have distinct developmental profiles and sensory responses, but how their fundamental polarity differences translate to functional outputs remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide anatomical evidence for distinct neurotransmitter release strategies among these closely related dopaminergic subtypes: anaxonic cells release from their dendrites, while axon-bearing neurons release exclusively from their intermittently myelinated axon. These structural differences are linked to a clear functional distinction: anaxonic, but not axon-bearing, dopaminergic neurons are capable of self-inhibition. Our findings suggest that variations in polarity can produce striking distinctions in neuronal outputs, and that even closely related neuronal subclasses may play entirely separate roles in sensory information processing."

    "content": "Background: The development of new drugs against afflictions that disproportionately impact poorly resourced areas around the globe is an expensive endeavor. As cost-effective alternatives, strategic combinations of approved drugs can be used to enhance the efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum. Understanding the metabolic consequences of such combinations is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and delaying drug resistance. Methods: An integrated metabolomic and pharmacological analysis was performed on P. falciparum exposed to chloroquine (CQ), pyrimethamine (PY), sulfadoxine (SD), and their combinations (SDPY and SDCQ). Dose-response assays were used to quantify drug potency, whereas untargeted metabolomic profiling was used to assess pathway-level perturbations associated with individual and combined treatments. Results: Dose-response assays confirmed the nanomolar potency of PY (IC50; = 12.5 nM) and CQ (IC50; = 11 nM) compared with the micromolar efficacy of SD (IC50; = 9.1 microM), which is consistent with its role as a synergistic antifolate partner. Metabolomic profiling revealed that PY strongly disrupted folate-dependent pyrimidine biosynthesis, leading to deoxyuridine and dUMP accumulation, whereas SD caused milder perturbations, which was consistent with DHPS inhibition. CQ produced modest metabolic effects alone but markedly amplified antifolate-induced stress when combined with PY. Drug combinations generated metabolic responses that are distinct from those resulting from individual treatments. Across antifolate combinations, consistent trends included reduced amino acid pools, suppression of thiamine and glutathione metabolism, and enhanced PPP inhibition, leading to broad disruption of nucleotide, redox, and carbon metabolism. Conclusions: Pyrimidine suppression has emerged as the central hallmark of antifolate-based therapy in P. falciparum. The distinct synergistic signatures observed with drug combinations support their potential to enhance efficacy and delay resistance. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for guiding antimalarial combination policies, optimizing therapeutic regimens, and strengthening rational drug-design strategies."

While its upstream regulation is well studied, the mechanisms by which MAPK activation leads to diverse transcriptional outcomes remain incompletely understood. To address this shortcoming, we mapped the target gene sets controlled by 22 RAF-inducible transcription factors using targeted Perturb-seq and integrated these data with time-resolved transcriptional profiling. Network reconstruction revealed a topology dominated by two central hubs, EGR1 and FOS, which co-regulate partially overlapping target gene sets. In addition, we uncovered a positive feedback loop between EGR1, a canonical RAF-MAPK effector, and TCF7, a transcription factor typically linked to Wnt signaling. Through this interaction, TCF7 emerges as a nexus that integrates MAPK and Wnt pathway inputs. Together, these findings define the architecture of RAF-MAPK-driven transcriptional regulation and demonstrate how cross-talk between oncogenic signaling pathways can be encoded in transcriptional networks."

We characterised fungal communities of two pine-feeding Ips bark beetles, I. sexdentatus and I. acuminatus, in larval, pupal, and adult stages, and in wild versus laboratory populations, using high-throughput ITS2 amplicon sequencing combined with qPCR and functional assays. Both beetles harboured a stable core mycobiome dominated by Kuraishia, Ogataea, Ophiostoma, Graphilbum and Cyberlindnera, while adults showed species-specific differences and wild beetles, especially I. acuminatus, exhibited greater diversity than laboratory populations. Beetles shared more taxa with unfed control wood than with gallery wood, indicating acquisition during feeding and concurrent restructuring of the wood mycobiome. Monoterpene bioassays on beetle-associated yeasts revealed that mixtures of -pinene, 3-carene and terpinolene suppressed growth more strongly than single compounds, suggesting synergistic inhibition. Yeasts selectively antagonised entomopathogenic fungi and expressed complementary cell-wall-lytic and digestive activities, consistent with combined roles in pathogen suppression and plant-polymer deconstruction. Our results show that Ips mycobiomes are conserved yet dynamic across life stages and environments, and emphasise the importance of multi-terpene and interaction assays for understanding bark beetle-fungus-conifer interactions."

    "content": "Cholera is a diarrheal disease that affects millions of people globally. Although the causative agent, Vibrio cholerae, has been extensively studied in isolation, investigation of its interactions with the gut microbiota started relatively recently. We and others previously showed that microbiota-derived metabolites significantly influence V. cholerae behavior. By investigating how an organic extract of human feces affects V. cholerae gene expression, we showed that gut metabolites strongly suppress swimming motility, a trait important for host colonization. Interestingly, extracts of pure cultures of a gut commensal, Enterocloster citroniae, recapitulated this inhibition. Here, we present a comprehensive examination of the effect of small molecules produced by E. citroniae and related species on V. cholerae behavior. We show that E. citroniae small molecules inhibit motility by various V. cholerae strains, and that several phylogenetically related species produce this activity, although the magnitude of the effect varies between strains. Using biofilm formation assays in static and flow conditions, we show that V. cholerae strongly induces biofilm formation in response to E. citroniae metabolites. Transcriptome and reporter analyses showed that several genes involved in synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide are induced by E. citroniae metabolites. Lastly, we show that V. cholerae interactions with host cells are also modulated by this commensal. These findings advance our understanding of microbiome-pathogen interactions and how commensal bacteria influence V. cholerae virulence through the production of small molecules. In the future, this knowledge may be used to design novel microbiome-based therapeutic approaches to combat cholera and other infections."

Both strains efficiently infected and replicated within tick cells, with ISE6 supporting more robust growth. Electron microscopy images revealed that Ot maintains its characteristic cytoplasmic, non-vacuolar location in tick cells and exits infected cells by budding off the surface in a membrane-encased structure. Time-course immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated progressive intracellular replication and dynamic expression of Ot outer membrane autotransporters ScaA and ScaC, with ScaC enriched early in infection and ScaA at later stages. Metabolic labelling using a clickable methionine analog L-homopropargylglycine showed that high ScaA abundance correlated with reduced translational activity, suggesting a link between ScaA abundance and late-stage or extracellular-like developmental states. The subcellular location of Ot in tick cells differs from the characteristic dynein-driven perinuclear clustering observed in mammalian cells, and was not sensitive to disruption of microtubules, indicating a distinct mode of distribution. Together, these findings identify tick cell lines as tractable and biologically relevant arthropod models for studying Ot and dissecting host-microbe interactions."

    "content": "The release of bacterial bioactive molecules across the gut barrier is a crucial yet poorly understood step in microbe-host communication. Here we unravel a phage-driven mechanism that enables this process in a nutritional symbiont. In Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NC8 (LpNC8), we identify a stress-inducible prophage, pp2, that undergoes genotoxic-stress-dependent activation and triggers holin-lysin-mediated lysis. This controlled lytic program produces phage particles together with extracellular, membrane-derived bacterial particles, and is strictly required for the ability of LpNC8 to promote juvenile growth in nutritionally challenged Drosophila melanogaster. Disruption of pp2-dependent lysis abolishes particle release in vitro and eliminates the growth-promoting effect in vivo, without altering bacterial abundance in the gut. The magnitude of phage release correlates with the extent of host growth promotion, indicating that prophage induction contributes to the export of symbiotic factors. These findings reveal prophage-induced lysis as a central and previously unrecognized mechanism by which a beneficial gut bacterium enhances host development under nutritional stress."

    "content": "Population-specific variation in animal microbiomes is well documented, yet the functional consequences and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this, we conducted genome-resolved metagenomic analyses on gut and skin microbiomes from four populations of Pyrenean brook salamanders (Calotriton asper) inhabiting two distinct environments (Pyrenean subalpine brooks and Atlantic montane streams). From paired faecal and skin swab samples, we reconstructed 539 and 43 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), respectively, and examined taxonomic composition, metabolic capacity, and microdiversity across environments. While alpha diversity remained consistent, both gut and skin microbiomes exhibited significant differences in community composition and functional potential between environments. Partitioning the gut microbiome into core, endemic, and marginal fractions revealed a dominant core community, shared across environments and accounting for over 85% of reads, that did not drive functional divergence. Instead, functional differences were primarily shaped by low-abundance, population-specific endemic bacteria. Atlantic salamanders hosted endemic taxa with significantly greater metabolic potential and higher strain-level microdiversity than those at the Pyrenees. These patterns were not explained by dietary differences and may reflect environmental influences such as temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings highlight the relevance of rare, endemic bacteria in driving microbiome function and underscore the power of genome-resolved metagenomics to uncover functional and evolutionary dynamics in wild host-microbe systems."

Their global diversity results from various local variables, including technological practices, as well as the metabolic activity of diverse microorganisms. In Europe, this typicity is exemplified by Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses, for which genetic diversity remains largely unexplored. Combining culturomics (n = 373 bacterial genomes) and metagenomic (n = 146 metagenomes), we performed a national-scale survey of the microbial diversity encompassing 44 French PDO cheeses. Taxonomic (bacteria, fungi and viruses) and functional profiling reveal a high diversity in the cheese rind, mainly driven by the cheese technology. We also reconstructed 1,119 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) encompassing seven phyla, including Actinomycetota, Bacillota, Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota. Using GTDB as a reference, we identified 221 MAGs encompassing 46 genera, as well as 44 bacterial isolate genomes encompassing eight genera, which represent potentially 81 new species (based on <95% ANI). These species were particularly numerous among the genera Halomonas, Psychrobacter and Brachybacterium. Similar results were observed when compared with the cFMD database. We combined our genomic and metagenomic datasets into a catalog of 26.2 million protein clusters, with 50% of these clusters remaining unassigned to a known function and taxonomy. We illustrated the potential of this resource by searching for methionine gamma-lyase (MGL), an enzyme playing a significant role in cheese flavor. This protein was predominantly found in Pseudoalteromonas, a potentially new MGL-producing genus, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Hafnia, and its prevalence varied with cheese technology. Our study provides a substantial genomic resource for food microbiologists and cheesemakers to further explore the biotechnological potential of PDO cheese biodiversity."

Ciliates are particularly abundant and diverse in anoxia, but their global diversity and distribution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of public 18S rDNA datasets, along with one dataset generated here, to assess the global diversity and ecology of marine anaerobic ciliates. Using a novel pipeline, we processed 2854 samples from 42 studies spanning 19 habitat types. We recovered 3196 anaerobic ciliate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) across all described lineages. Based on clade-specific divergence thresholds derived from phylogenetic distances, 28.4-46.3% of ASVs qualified as novel. Most sequences belonged to the poorly described plagiopylean family Epalxellidae, suggesting a large reservoir of undescribed diversity in this clade. Community comparisons revealed close phylogenetic similarities between some shallow-water and deep-sea assemblages, suggesting that shared redox conditions may shape communities more than water depth. Our results demonstrate that marine anaerobic ciliates are globally distributed, taxonomically diverse, and rich in novel lineages. This study provides a framework for leveraging environmental sequencing data to better understand the diversity and ecology of neglected protist lineages and under-sampled habitats."

While the dynamic changes in genome organization in cellular organisms have been well described, the 3D folding of phage genomes during the infection of their host is extremely limited. Understanding how phage genomes fold, invade and rearrange the genome of their host to functionally organize the optimal expression of their genes remains unknown. Here, we explore the spatial dynamics of the virulent double-stranded DNA phage PAK_P3 during infection of its host Pseudomonas aeruginosa and reveal how its genome rapidly decondenses to adopt a specific 3D organization that reflects its transcriptional program. Concomitantly, the host genome decondenses as gene expression wanes and transcription induced domains vanish. We also uncover specific and discrete bridging of the host and the phage genomes, showing how the phage genome exploits the spatial genome architecture of its host to succeed in its infection cycle. Our data highlights an unprecedented level of genome folding and gene expression regulation during a viral infection."

Co-selection is now recognised as a significant driver of antimicrobial resistance, with established links between heavy metal exposure and the presence of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance. The precise mechanisms that drive this process in the environment are co-resistance, cross-resistance, and co-regulation, but their respective impacts remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated whether heavy metal contamination in freshwater sediments selects for bacteria harbouring plasmids that carry both metal and antibiotic resistance genes, or genes encoding cross-resistance mechanisms. A diverse set of plasmids was recovered from metal-impacted sites at Lake Macquarie (New South Wales, Australia), which carried resistance genes particularly to copper, zinc, cobalt, cadmium, and arsenic. Two-thirds of these plasmids also carried one or more antibiotic resistance genes, indicating co-selection through the co-resistance mechanism. Functional assessment confirmed that the multi-metal and polymyxin resistance plasmid genotype was linked to the corresponding bacterial phenotype. The metagenome of the metal-impacted sediments was also examined to explore evidence of co-selection, and a broad range of incomplete plasmid sequences containing homologues of both metal- and antibiotic-resistance genes was detected. This study demonstrates the important link between anthropogenic heavy metal contamination and potentially clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes. It highlights the importance of approaching the management of antimicrobial resistance from a One Health perspective."

In Campylobacter jejuni, the stochastic nature of PV has hindered the systematic functional analysis of phase-variable genes (PVGs). Here, we introduce PV-GenShift, a genome-scale screening platform built on a genetically stabilized library of phase-locked C. jejuni variants. By fixing the ON/OFF states of 15 PVGs, PV-GenShift enables reproducible, high-resolution analysis of phasotypes, defined as unique ON/OFF combinations across multiple PVGs, under defined selective pressures. Using models of human serum exposure, murine colonization, and chicken gut passage, we identified distinct phasotypes associated with serum resistance and with enrichment during mouse colonization, particularly involving capsular polysaccharide modifications such as O-methyl phosphoramidation and methylation. In contrast, chicken gut passage resulted in heterogeneous ON/OFF shifts without a dominant phasotype. These findings highlight the combinatorial impact of PVG expression states on bacterial adaptation and establish PV-GenShift as a broadly applicable framework for dissecting PV-driven phenotypic diversity. This approach provides a scalable strategy for exploring genotype-phenotype relationships and offers insights relevant to vaccine design and targeted therapeutics."

Deep-learning predictions identified 5.47 million candidate antimicrobial peptides (c_AMPs), revealing a peptide space far larger and structurally distinct from known AMPs. Deep-sea c_AMPs are longer, enriched in nonpolar and acidic residues, and exhibit low charge and high intrinsic disorder, suggesting non-membranolytic modes of action. We synthesized 131 representative peptides, of which 87% were antimicrobial, with MICs as low as 1.25 M, broad-spectrum antibacterial and even antifungal efficacy, and minimal mammalian cytotoxicity. Transcriptomics, TEM imaging, and peptide-protein modeling showed that representative peptides preserve membrane integrity while disrupting intracellular processes such as translation and metabolism, supporting intracellular, non-lytic mechanisms. This work uncovers a vast reservoir of previously unrecognized deep-sea small proteins and structurally unconventional AMPs, providing a foundational resource for discovering next-generation peptide therapeutics."

This pigment results from alterations in tyrosine catabolism. Melanin synthesis from tryptophan has never been reported in Pseudomonas. In this study, we describe a tryptophan-derived melanin in P. aeruginosa PAH, a strain that was isolated from a fibrocystic patient. PAH produced a brown pigment when grown in LB or L-tryptophan-supplemented media. Structural analysis revealed this pigment was composed by two fractions differing in NaOH solubility: a soluble one consistent of pyomelanin, and an insoluble fraction with a complex structure containing substituted indolic units. A pyomelanin inhibitor enhanced total melanin synthesis, mainly the insoluble fraction, and a tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor decreased pigment formation. Metabolomic profiling identified distinct indolic compounds and low levels of anthranilate in PAH cultures. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the presence of mutations and downregulation of genes related to pyoverdine biosynthesis. Furthermore, iron supplementation in the culture medium reduced melanin production. Overall, tryptophan arises as a key compound for melanin production in PAH, expanding the diversity of melanins synthesized by this genus. Furthermore, iron deprivation emerges as a critical factor triggering melanin biosynthesis, probably as a survival strategy enabling persistence in the fibrocystic lung environment."

Despite the rising incidence and clinical concern of Mab infections, treatment options are limited and often ineffective. Treatment is complicated by Mabs ability to persist in a non-replicative, drug-resistant state. Several {beta}-lactam antibiotics are potently bactericidal against Mab but are underutilized because their molecular mechanisms of action against Mab are incompletely understood. In the current study, we used {beta}-lactam-derived activity-based probes and chemoproteomics to report the first comprehensive list of enzymes in Mab targeted by {beta}-lactams. We compared {beta}-lactam targets across two Mab subspecies in actively replicating and non-replicative cultures, using a new carbon starvation model of persistence. We identified 17 targets that were active in every condition tested, seven of which were previously unknown to bind {beta}-lactams. Lastly, we characterized the {beta}-lactamase activity and {beta}-lactam inhibition profiles of nine Mab enzymes, demonstrating that imipenem inhibits these targets more effectively than cefoxitin. These findings provide clarity on the mechanisms of action of clinically relevant {beta}-lactams in Mab, a crucial step toward fully realizing their potential for treating infections caused by this opportunistic pathogen."

These bacteria employ various virulence factors, including extracellular type IV pili (T4P), which serve as essential appendages for DNA uptake, biofilm formation, and resistance to antibiotics. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bacteriophages (phages) exploit these retractile pili as entry receptors, but the exact mechanism of viral RNA delivery following pilus binding and retraction remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the entry mechanism of the ssRNA phage AP205 by identifying the specific phage components necessary for T4P detachment, a key step in viral genome entry. Our data reveals the phage's maturation protein (Mat) is sufficient to induce pilus detachment on its own, and the overall virion structure further enhances the efficiency of this process. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how ssRNA phages exploit bacterial T4P as part of their infection pathway and suggest a conserved strategy for host entry."

    "content": "Background: The interactions between the host organism and the microbiota play an important role in the host's survival, influencing its physiology and adaptation. The Antarctic, due to its extreme living conditions, is a unique region for studying such interactions. However, research on the microbiomes of Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates remains limited, especially with regard to the region's sole endemic insect, Belgica antarctica. Our aim was to study the B. antarctica microbiome collected from different substrates and from varying ornithogenic influence levels. Methods: A total of 330 B. antarctica larvae and moss substrates were sampled at three sites with different ornithogenic impact, followed by DNA extraction using Qiagen kits. The V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, followed by bioinformatic processing in QIIME2 for OTU clustering, taxonomic classification, and diversity analysis. Further analysis and visualization was performed in R, Python and GraphPad Prism. Results: Amplicon sequencing revealed rich microbial diversity, with NMDS demonstrating clear clustering of samples according to their origin (insects vs substrate) and ornithogenic influence level. Comparative analysis revealed that the vast majority of OTUs associated with B. antarctica (ca. 95%) were shared with substrates, whereas the insect-specific fraction was small, highly variable, and partially influenced by moss species. Ornithogenic influence significantly structured the symbiotic microbiota in both insects and substrates, reducing microbial diversity and altering the relative abundance of major bacterial taxa. Overall, substrate type and ornithogenic impact are significant factors influencing microbial community structure, while insect-specific taxa formed only a minor, heterogeneous component of this midge microbiome. Additionally, the Wolbachia infection was detected in B. antarctica larvae for the first time. Conclusion: The substrate that B. antarctica inhabits, as well as ornithogenic influence, play a significant role in the shaping of the species' microbiome. This Antarctic chironomid also maintains a core microbial community. The detection of Wolbachia in B. antarctica is the first evidence of this endosymbiont in Antarctica."

In this study we analysed the capsule genetics of E. coli ST131 by interrogating 3,033 genomes. Our data show a clonal distribution of capsule types and identify a monophyletic group of ST131 clade C strains which are characterised by an atypical capsule operon with highly divergent alleles of the key kpsM and kpsT genes. Our analysis suggests there is ongoing evolution within clade C of ST131 which looks to be driven not by continuing evolution of antimicrobial resistance, but by host-pathogen interactions."

Yet, its influence on the invasion success of genetically resistant strains remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the influence of bacterial heteroresistance, growth, and antibiotic selection on the outcome of an invasion experiment. We quantified the invasion dynamics of a bioluminescent colistin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain across a colistin concentration gradient during co-culture with colistin-susceptible clinical P. aeruginosa isolates with varying levels of heteroresistance. The observed variation in heteroresistance and fitness of the clinical isolates allowed investigation of the impact of these factors on invasion dynamics. We hypothesized that fitter isolates would limit invasion through competitive exclusion, while heteroresistant isolates, despite their growth costs, may serve as reservoirs for resistance evolution under antibiotic selection. Our results show that in antibiotic-free conditions, faster-growing isolates competitively excluded the colistin resistant invader while isolates with high levels of heteroresistance failed to do so. This competitive landscape shifted with increasing colistin concentration, giving the invader a fitness advantage that peaked around 2-4xMIC of the clinical isolate. The shift in the landscape over the colistin gradient might further have been influenced by the presence of heteroresistance in the clinical isolates. These findings reveal how both heteroresistance and competitive exclusion shapes invasion dynamics. Understanding these interactions is critical for redesigning treatment strategies that minimize ecological opportunities for resistant strains to establish and expand."

In the wild type, regulator EcpR/MatA demonstrated the highest correlation with the biofilm intensity, and its role was, in particular, seemingly reinforced by stress/pH-homeostasis and c-di-GMP-linked factors. duxuR exhibited the strongest stochasticity in biofilm formation, while in duxuR-tr, replicate dispersion was mostly muted, indicating that uxuR-derived sRNAs buffer motility-adhesion switching. In dcrp, pgaA was de-repressed due to the absence of CsrA, with expression being highly consistent with intensity of biofilm formation, alongside stress/ion-homeostasis genes. This is in line with the suggestion that CRP regulates biofilms and motility indirectly via regulation of more local transcription factors. Overall, replicate-resolved clustering converts apparent \"noise\" into structured regulatory patterns, which include genes whose role in biofilm formation was not yet evident, and helps identify switch nodes between planktonic and biofilm bacterial states."

    "content": "Antibiotic resistance is often assumed to be constrained by fitness costs that limit the spread of highly resistant strains. Yet, many resistance mechanisms -- including enzymatic antibiotic degradation -- can arise with little or no metabolic cost, raising an important question: why is extreme resistance not more widespread? Here, we show that community-level interactions impose a hidden ecological cost on high resistance. By performing experiments with simple communities comprised of antibiotic resistant clinical isolates and an antibiotic susceptible strain, we find that when exposed to betalactam antibiotics, strains with a higher degree of antibiotic resistance can promote the survival of co-habiting susceptible strains. Guided by mean-field modeling, we find that highly resistant bacteria accelerate detoxification of the shared environment, shortening the period during which resistance confers a competitive advantage. Experiments with an engineered strain with tunable resistance level confirm that susceptible cells grow best in the presence of highly resistant strains. Importantly, this effect does not require evolved cooperation or active enzyme secretion; experimental and modeling results show that unavoidable processes, such as cell death or passive leakage, prevent complete privatization of resistance, giving rise to ``accidental cooperation\". These findings suggest that resistance evolution is not only shaped by intrinsic cellular costs but also by ecological feedback that limits the benefits of incremental increases in resistance. This result may be reflected in the phenotypic responses of the clinical strains tested in this work, which fell into distinct low- and high-resistance classes with no intermediate phenotypes. Thus, this work demonstrates the important role of community dynamics in understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance and treatment outcomes."

Here, we systematically explore the effect of five core bacteria, Snodgrassella alvi, Bifidobacterium asteroides, BombilactobacillusFirm-4, Lactobacillus Firm-5, and Gilliamella apicola, on the longevity of individual honey bees. Generating gnotobiotic bees harboring all 32 different combinations of the core bacteria, we found that bacterial colonization generally reduces the host lifespan. This indicates that despite commensal gut microbes coevolved with the host, their presence is in principle costly for survival of individual bees. Regression analysis including higher-order interactions reveals that bacterial interactions have significant impacts on the host lifespan and show a qualitative trend: 2- and 4-way interactions exhibit positive, while 3- and 5-way interactions are negative. Numerical simulations based on a general Lotka-Volterra model demonstrate that the observed trend is reproduced when competitive interactions dominate in the bacterial community. This study combining empirical and theoretical approaches suggests the general costs of harboring gut microbiota and the stabilization of the bacterial community by higher-order interactions, which will advance our understanding of how commensal gut microbes and their interactions specifically influence host physiology."

    "content": "Above-ground vertical structure is a critical variable for ecosystem monitoring, carbon accounting, and land management. However, the high cost and limited coverage of airborne lidar hinder its widespread application. To address this, we developed NAIP-CHM, a 0.6-meter resolution canopy height and structure model (CHM) covering the contiguous United States, derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery. Unlike forestry-specific models that exclude human-made features, NAIP-CHM characterizes the full vertical structure of the landscape including vegetation, buildings, and infrastructure. We utilized a U-Net convolutional neural network with attention mechanisms and environmental conditioning, training the model on 18 million lidar-derived training pairs with stratified sampling to ensure robustness in open-canopy ecosystems. Assessing performance against 2.3 million independent samples, the model achieved a root mean square error of 1.57 meters and coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.87. We release the dataset, source code, and cloud-based tools to enable broad application without requiring specialized computational resources."

    "content": "Body size in mammals spans 20 orders of magnitude and is strongly correlated with ecology, making it one of the most important characteristics for a mammal. Body mass must be estimated for fossil mammals because the whole organism is rarely fully preserved. Although the relationships between anatomical characters and body mass have been calculated for many groups of mammals, rodents are less well studied. Previous work had limited sampling of species or used a species average for body size and may not be accurate. Because rodents are the most species rich order of mammals having accurate relationships for the different families of rodents is crucial for understanding the evolution of body size in rodents. I analysed the relationship between body size and three skull characters (skull, molar (M1), and toothrow length) in 11 species of cricetid rodents from Nebraska using reduced major axis regressions. I found a significant positive relationship between all characters and body size. Skull and toothrow length are the best predictors of body size. M1 length is not as good of a predictor because one genus (Microtus) has an unusually large M1 length for its body size. Separate regression equations for the Arvicolines and the Sigmodontids provide better predictors for body size using lower M1 length. This work will allow for more accurate predictions of body mass in extinct cricetids."

    "content": "In wildlife research, wild-caught vertebrates are often given anti-parasitic drugs when brought into captivity to protect animal health and reduce confounding effects of parasitic infection on research outcomes. However, the impacts of antiparasitic drugs on non-target parasite taxa are understudied, especially regarding host sex. To help address this gap, we investigated the impact of an anthelmintic medication on a protozoan gut parasite by quantifying coccidia oocyst burden in the feces of wild-caught dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) before and after two oral doses of ivermectin. Prior to treatment, males showed higher oocyst burdens than females. Following treatment, ivermectin-treated males showed larger increases in oocyst burden compared to both control males and ivermectin-treated females, while there was no difference in baseline and post-treatment oocyst burden in treated females. Our results suggest that wild-caught songbirds should be housed separately by sex during ivermectin treatment and that male enclosures should be cleaned at a relatively higher frequency due to excessive oocyst shedding. It is unclear whether increases in oocyst burden among males were attributable to helminth removal or a direct impact of ivermectin on host immune function. Further work investigating sex differences in the impact of antiparasitic drugs on non-target parasite taxa is warranted."

    "content": "The ambrosia beetle Platypus cylindrus Fab. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Platypodinae) has been associated in Portugal with cork oak (Quercus suber) tree death since the 1980s. Although traditionally known as a secondary pest damaging stressed and dead trees, its aggressiveness changed over the last decades. Ambrosia beetle is an insect known for its interactions with several species of fungi aiming for the gain of biologic functions that facilitates its life cycle. How bacterial communities harbored by ambrosia beetle impact forest ecosystems is not yet well known. In oak species, some pathogenic bacteria are often associated with wood insect infestations. From P. cylindrus body and wood tree bored galleries, culture dependent methods led to the isolation of bacteria involved in wood degradation and beetle ecology and even a new bacterial cork oak pathogen. To complement colony isolation efforts for the identification of the beetle-cork oak associated bacterial community, the same samples were analyzed with 16S metabarcoding. Two distinct bacterial communities from beetle mycangia and wood galleries sharing the most abundant bacterial taxa were revealed. A group of genera from Enterobacterales and Bradyrhizobium prevailed in the samples from wood galleries. Comparison between ASVs and full 16S sequences allowed the identification of Pectobacteriaceae as the major taxon from unclassified Enterobacterales carried by the beetle. Prediction of metabolic pathways varying between wood galleries and beetle mycangia revealed upregulation in the galleries of carbohydrate and virulence factors. Together, these analyses efficiently compared the bacteriome from the wood galleries with the beetle mycangia, revealing different bacterial communities and specific ecological roles related to both the beetle and trees. Additionally, they gave insights into the comparability of culture-dependent and independent methods in bacteriome analysis."

    "content": "Conservation biocontrol is crucial for crop pest management, but the impact of agricultural management practices on natural enemies of crop pests is poorly characterised. The timing of crop sowing could impact arthropod communities by altering basal resource availability and quality, manifesting in altered nutrient availability and cascading impacts to natural enemy fitness and function. This study aims to understand these potential modifiers of conservation biocontrol, by investigating how the timing of crop sowing impacts arthropod predator nutrition and whether associated differences relate to changes in prey availability. Arthropod predators and their prey were collected from adjacent plots of winter- and spring-sown wheat. The biochemical macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid and protein) content of predators was determined by colorimetric assays and compared between winter- and spring-sown crops using multivariate models. Predator nutrient contents were compared to predator-prey interactions inferred using null network models based on both recent and current prey availability. The nutrient contents of arthropod predators differed significantly between winter- and spring-sown wheat, and the prey available to predators similarly differed, but neither recent nor current prey availability explained differences in predator nutrition. These findings may indicate that prey quality, rather than identity, changes with the developmental stages of crops sown at different times. This has important implications for the spillover of natural enemies of crop pests between crops sown at different times. This is especially true following harvest of winter-sown crops, which may disrupt biocontrol by altering the nutrients available to and sought by natural enemies of crop pests."

    "content": "Current epidemiological models for the regulation of host populations by pathogens suggest that the reduction in the host population is largest shortly after the epidemic phase and that the host population partly recovers in the subsequent approach to endemicity. We find that this conventional view is not robust to a simple, biologically motivated addition: density-dependent population regulation (homeostasis). While rapid homeostasis typically enables a population rebound after the initial population suppression (the conventional view), but weak homeostasis results in the opposite --- greater population suppression during the endemic phase compared to the initial epidemic. The effect of homeostasis can be substantial. This finding complicates the prediction of long term outcomes of population suppression by pathogens but not of short term outcomes."

A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current.

However, current fabrication methods often suffer from limited gradient precision, restricted material compatibility, and poor reproducibility. Here, we introduced gradient regulation via acoustofluidic dynamic engineering (GRADE), a programmable system to generate high-fidelity gradient biomaterials across different material systems. By incorporating focused interdigital transducers with the pulsed surface acoustic wave actuation, GRADE can achieve tunable and directional acoustic streaming (0 to 22\u00a0millimeters per second), which allows accurate regulation of the gradient magnitude and length. Its open microchannel design enables nondestructive extraction of centimeter-scale gradients and supports device reuse, enhancing practicality and scalability. In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform\u2019s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication.

Building on our prior glycine-proline\u2013based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit.

Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25\u00b0 to 95\u00b0C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release.

Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease sequencing (CUT&amp;RUN) revealed increased astrocytic CREB DNA binding in response to cocaine. Viral-mediated manipulation of nucleus accumbens astrocytic CREB activity in combination with addiction-related behaviors revealed that astrocytic CREB increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine. Furthermore, we identified potential molecular mechanisms of astrocytic CREB\u2019s influence through modulating astrocytic calcium dynamics and selectively increasing D1-type medium spiny neuronal activity.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression.

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities.

    "content": "Predicting how climate change will affect the population dynamics and ultimately persistence of plant and animal populations is a grand challenge in biodiversity science and global change biology. Competing approaches have emerged for how to explicitly connect climate drivers to demography. In our manuscript, we synthesise this rapidly moving field while highlighting strengths and limitations of competing approaches; provide a practical guide for using environment\u2010explicit demographic modelling to predict population dynamics; and offer guidance for how to overcome challenges associated with prediction and forecasting in this realm.\n\nABSTRACT\nPredicting the effects of climate change on plant and animal populations is an urgent challenge for understanding the fate of biodiversity under global change. At the surface, quantifying how climate drives the vital rates that underlie population dynamics appears simple, yet many decisions are required to connect climate to demographic data. Competing approaches have emerged in the literature with little consensus around best practices. Here we provide a practical guide for how to best link vital rates to climate for the purposes of inference and projection of population dynamics. We first describe the sources of demographic and climate data underlying population models. We then focus on best practices to model the relationships between vital rates and climate, highlighting what we can learn from mechanistic and phenomenological models. Finally, we discuss the challenges of prediction and forecasting in the face of uncertainty about climate\u2010demographic relationships as well as future climate. We conclude by suggesting ways forward to build this field of research into one that makes robust forecasts of population persistence, with opportunities for synthesis across species."

Sutton, Katia Koelle</p>\n\nIn an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aim to identify animal viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans. These studies have revealed substantial diversity in identified viruses. However, the number of tools currently available to assess pandemic risk is limited. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using <i>in vitro</i> laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outcomes that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we use within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals to estimate parameters relevant to transmission between pairs of individuals. We then extend this model to estimate epidemiological parameters, such as reproduction numbers and generation intervals. We present our analytical framework in the context of two influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (Cal/2009) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (Hong Kong/1968). In a head-to-head comparison, we find that Cal/2009 has higher pandemic potential than Hong Kong/1968. Our results depend on several assumptions, including that within-host viral dynamics in humans and those in the model animal used (here, ferrets) share quantitative similarities and that viral transmissibility between model animals reflects viral transmissibility between humans. The methods we present to assess pandemic risk of viral isolates can be used to improve relative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern."

    "content": "<p>by Christopher H. Bohrer, Daniel R. Larson</p>\n\nNumerous functions hinge on the spatial arrangement of different genomic loci. Hence, microscopy techniques, such as chromatin tracing, have been developed to localize multiple loci in fixed cells. Depending on the throughput and specifics of the experiment, localization errors can still obscure the true spatial locations. We have developed a post-processing methodology to address this challenge without the need for additional experimentation: Loci Enabled Advanced Resolution (LEAR). By leveraging the fact that localization errors increase the variability of the displacements between loci, and given an approximation of the localization error, we can approximate the ground truth spatial variation for each pair of loci to guide an iterative error correction process. After validating our approach with simulation and experiment, we then applied our approach to existing chromatin tracing data that probed the relation between chromatin organization and <i>Sox2</i> regulation, where previous work found no clear correlation between enhancer-promoter proximity and transcription bursts in individual cells. We discovered a correlation previously obscured by localization error, clearly demonstrating the need for the methodology. We then investigated the influence of loop-extrusion on higher order multi-way contact frequencies, which dramatically increased with the application of the LEAR method, finding that certain multi-way contacts were only present with loop-extrusion."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/106201",
    "content": "Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal network oscillations associated with memory consolidation. They are characterized by the co-occurrence of fast and slow field potentials across CA1 layers: the fast-frequency oscillations, known as ripples, are prominent in the pyramidal cell layer, where they coincide with increased neuronal spiking, while slower negative transients, referred to as sharp waves, occur simultaneously in the <i>stratum radiatum</i>. SWRs have traditionally been considered globally synchronous across the hippocampus; however, recent evidence suggests that ripples may be less synchronous than previously thought, particularly between the two hemispheres (Villalobos et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited this question using a unique dataset from probes spanning the septo-temporal axis of CA1 in rats. Our results demonstrate that ripples are phase-locked within but not between hemispheres, although their occurrence remains time-locked across both the septo-temporal axis and hemispheres. We also observed a similar synchronicity pattern for spiking activity: neurons are locally phase-coupled and globally time-coupled to ripple events. Interneurons exhibit a much stronger phase coupling to both ipsilateral and contralateral ripples than pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that ripples are locally phase-coupled through pyramidal\u2013interneuron interactions, with global time-locking likely driven by a common bilateral CA3 input and potentially modulated by interneuron circuits."

We find a significant reduction in TACL\u2013S in the northern mid\u2010latitudes, dominated by stronger winter land warming, alongside an increase in the northern high latitudes, dominated by stronger winter sea warming, during 1941\u20132014. In particular, these anthropogenic changes are projected to intensify in 2015\u20132100, with an additional emergence of TACL\u2013S increases dominated by summer land warming in the southern mid\u2010latitudes. Thus, a future tripolar pattern of TACL\u2013S heralds novel land\u2013sea climate regimes with far\u2010reaching climatic impacts."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Arctic has seen dramatic changes in recent decades. Here we use a simple metric, the Arctic residence time of air, that is, the time air spends uninterruptedly north of 70\u00b0 ${}^{\\circ}$N, to evaluate how these changes have affected the high\u2010latitude atmospheric circulation in the last 40\u00a0years. We find that, on average, near\u2010surface air resides between 7 (winter) and 12 (summer) days in the Arctic. This residence time has decreased almost year\u2010round since the 1980s, especially pronounced in the seasonal transition periods (fall: \u2212 ${-}$0.9\u00a0days; spring: \u2212 ${-}$1.4\u00a0days). The more pronounced reduction in spring also affects higher atmospheric layers. Our analysis indicates that this reduction is likely linked to the observed sea ice loss, decrease in snow cover, and increase in temperature. Furthermore, it indicates a speed\u2010up of the circulation, effectively making the Arctic less isolated and more prone to influences from mid\u2010latitudes."

At Sumisu Caldera, trapdoor faulting has recurred quasi\u2010regularly, roughly at \u223c10\u2010year intervals, generating earthquakes of moment magnitude 5.4\u20135.7 and producing tsunamis due to meter\u2010scale co\u2010seismic uplift. To assess event similarity and infer controlling factors, we compare seismic and tsunami waveforms at broadband period range (0.2\u2013500\u00a0s). The 1996, 2015, and 2024 events exhibit nearly identical waveforms, indicating rupture of a persistent major asperity with stable geometry and processes. Similar but non\u2010identical earthquakes suggest partial rupture or additional minor asperities. Comparable repeating sequences at other submarine calderas further support that trapdoor faulting is generally governed by major asperities, while variations in recurrence patterns may reflect differences in fault properties among calderas. These results demonstrate that trapdoor faulting recurrency is controlled by major asperities on ring faults, sustained by long\u2010term, stable magma supply."

While riverine sediment is well studied, marine\u2010sourced sediment remains understudied, particularly in regions with limited river input. We examined the influence of marine\u2010sourced sediment on salt marsh stability across 103 sites in the Northeastern US, using a new satellite\u2010derived suspended sediment concentration (SSC) product. Marsh vulnerability was assessed using the Unvegetated\u2010to\u2010Vegetated Ratio (UVVR) and relative marsh elevation (Z*). We identified two thresholds: SSC >20\u00a0mg/L and RSLR <5.2\u00a0mm/year. Marshes meeting either threshold tended to remain intact, while those with both low SSC and high RSLR were more vulnerable to degradation. A north\u2013south gradient was observed, with most unstable marshes in the southern region, where SSC declined by 0.9% per decade on average, compared to 0.072% in the north.

    "content": "Abstract\nMachine learning (ML) precipitation forecasting models typically employ a mean squared error\u00a0(MSE) loss function for optimization. However, due to the well\u2010known \u201cdouble penalty\u201d effect, MSE\u2010based losses often lead to overly smoothed prediction fields and a systematic underestimation of the frequency of\u00a0heavy rainfall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel probability\u2010matching (PM) based loss for ML precipitation nowcasting and short\u2010term forecasting, comparing its performance with other classical losses. Comprehensive skill evaluation demonstrates that PM\u2010based loss offers relatively more balanced and consistent performance across metrics, particularly its lower forecast bias from light to heavy rainfall intensities. Spectral power analysis further indicates that PM\u2010based loss better preserves small\u2010scale precipitation variability throughout the forecast period. Additionally, it results in a forecast frequency distribution of precipitation that more closely aligns with the observed distribution. These findings indicate consistent improvements in predictive skill and reliability of ML precipitation forecasts when trained with the PM\u2010based loss."

The model is applied to MJ\u22654.0 ${M}_{J}\\ge 4.0$ earthquakes that occurred between 2001 and 2010 around the Kakioka (KAK) station in Japan, with two types of anomalies, ultralow frequency (ULF) magnetic anomalies and carbon monoxide (CO) anomalies, as external excitations. Results indicate that 14.33% of the earthquakes can be interpreted by the external excitation of anomalies. Proposed ETAS\u00a0+\u00a0ULF\u00a0+\u00a0CO model achieves an overall probability gain of 1,013.55 in forecasting 218 earthquakes compared to the purely temporal ETAS model. Statistical significance is assessed by fitting the same model to the same earthquake catalog but with randomized anomaly occurrence times, confirming that the performance improvement is not due to overfitting.

We demonstrate that this boundary is marked by a distinct spectral change: a power\u2010law form in the plasma sheet transitions to an exponential form within the outer radiation belt. These findings are supported by comparisons with Polar\u2010orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) observations, and we discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for the spectral transition."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study investigates climate drivers influencing interannual changes in the rapid intensification (RI) ratio of western North Pacific tropical cyclones during July\u2013November from 1982 to 2024. We find a pronounced simultaneous correlation between basinwide RI ratio and the Aleutian Low index (ALI). In high ALI years when the Aleutian Low is weakened, the RI ratio is significantly reduced over the region spanning 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N, 135\u00b0E\u2013160\u00b0E, predominantly driven by enhanced 850\u2013200\u2010hPa vertical wind shear (VWS). Other commonly investigated RI\u2010related environmental variables show only small ALI\u2010driven modulations over the primary focus region of this study. In high ALI years, enhanced VWS is mainly induced by anomalous westerlies in the southeastern part of a broad anomalous cyclone centered in the subtropical central North Pacific. This anomalous cyclone can be further linked to strong wave activity fluxes originating from the AL region and propagating southward into the subtropical North Pacific."

    "content": "Abstract\nMass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet is largest in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, due to basal melting by warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW). In this study we find that subsurface temperature variability near the ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment from a global ocean\u2010sea ice model is able to track observed temperature variability and satellite\u2010derived basal melt rates. Simulated ocean temperature variability is controlled by a two\u2010stage response to the regional winds. A weakening of the prevailing southeasterly winds initially redistributes heat by lifting the thermocline, bringing warm mCDW up from depth near the ice shelf front. This is followed by a lagged widespread warming across the continental shelf due to water mass property changes, driven by horizontal advection and vertical mixing. Our results suggest a limited role of internal ocean variability and meltwater feedbacks on the observed variability on interannual timescales."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate models project a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) that will reduce Arctic warming. However, there is substantial intermodel spread in the projected AMOC decline, and its contribution to uncertainty in projected Arctic warming has not yet been quantified. To investigate this, we perform model experiments that increase CO2 concentrations while imposing the intermodel spread in the AMOC decline. We find that this intermodel spread in the AMOC decline reproduces 45% of the total intermodel spread in Arctic warming. A smaller AMOC decline increases Arctic warming via increased northward ocean heat transport, atmospheric moisture transport, and positive Arctic feedbacks. Arctic warming is more sensitive to AMOC differences that produce larger sea\u2010ice changes. Combined with a strong correlation between a small AMOC decline and Arctic warming across models, these results indicate that ocean circulation is a key source of model uncertainty in projections of Arctic warming."

    "content": "Abstract\nFault rocks vary in mineralogy but understanding the role of mineralogy in injection\u2010induced fault slip behavior remains challenging. We conduct laboratory fluid injection experiments on representative faults with distinct surface mineralogy, injecting fluid at a constant rate of 0.6\u00a0mL/min and under a confining pressure of 20\u00a0MPa, to examine how mineralogy affects fluid\u2010driven slip and seismicity. We find that the fault surface with a higher content of tectosilicates (quartz, microcline, albite, totaling 96%) exhibit higher shear strength. The tectosilicate\u2010rich fault takes a longer time to reactivate but accumulates seismic moment more rapidly, indicating more intense seismicity. In contrast, the fault containing\u00a0abundant phyllosilicates (50% biotite) promotes a transition from unsteady stick\u2010slip to steady slip during fluid injection. Stick\u2010slip events in the tectosilicate\u2010rich fault exhibit higher peak slip rates and greater slip displacements. We propose a microscopic mechanism to elaborate how fluids may influence mineral friction and thereby affect injection\u2010induced fault slip."

    "content": "Abstract\nMarine methane emissions are important components of natural methane budgets, but the methane emission contribution derived from the central Arctic is still unclear. Here, we measured the dissolved methane concentration and its stable carbon isotopic signature (\u03b413C\u2010CH4) while onboard a western Arctic cruise in 2024. In the shelf areas, the methane concentration was found to be 2\u20133 times higher than that at atmospheric equilibrium, corresponding to a \u03b413C\u2010CH4 value of less than \u221256.3\u2030, which suggests a methanogenic origin. In contrast, the waters in the offshore areas were under or slightly lower than atmospheric equilibrium, corresponding to more positive \u03b413C\u2010CH4 values (\u221248.4\u2030\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u2030). Persistent excess methane values in the offshore areas were detected in the water column. The mass balance suggested that the in situ production accounted for more than two\u2010thirds of the excess methane. In contrast, microbial oxidation removed over half of the methane pool. Finally, we calculated that the central Arctic can uptake 7.74\u2009\u00b1\u200911.76 Gg of methane in summer. The combined effect of sea ice melting/freezing and methane removal resulted in a 305% offset of methane diffusion, which provides evidence that the central Arctic, in contrast with the continental shelf region, currently makes a small contribution to atmospheric methane."

    "content": "Abstract\nHuman pressures are leading to the replacement of macroalgal forests by alternative opportunistic species on shallow temperate reefs. Nonetheless, the ecological consequences of habitat reconfiguration for coastal biodiversity and ecosystem functioning remain poorly quantified. By means of a field study, we compared the metabolic functioning and biodiversity of macroalgal forests dominated by the fucoid Ericaria brachycarpa at pristine sites with that of assemblages formed by a shrub\u2010like rhodophyte (i.e., Halopithys incurva) at urban sites. Dominant macroalgae at pristine and urban sites supported similar abundance and species richness of vagile invertebrates, but macroalgal forests supported higher invertebrate biomass. Shrub\u2010like assemblages at urban sites sustained an autotrophic metabolism with a net diel O2 production throughout the year, whereas macroalgal forests tended to be heterotrophic during warmer months. Diel fluxes of total dissolved inorganic carbon, as well as the contribution of production/respiration, were consistent with O2 fluxes, with E. brachycarpa forests functioning as a heterotrophic carbon source in summer. This could be the result of reduced photosynthetic performance of the dominant brown macroalga and/or increased community respiration in warmer seawater. Our findings suggest that benthic assemblages in urban areas, formed by large and architecturally complex macroalgae, do not markedly differ from those found in pristine areas in terms of supported biodiversity and may sustain a more stable autotrophic balance under varying environmental conditions. Avoiding further degradation of these urban habitats (i.e., shift from shrub\u2010like to mat\u2010like turfs) could be a viable strategy for sustaining ecosystem functioning along peri\u2010urban and urban Mediterranean coasts."

Here, we applied the eddy covariance (EC) technique to acquire 1\u2010yr (June 2023 to May 2024) NME measurements, over a subtropical macroalgae aquaculture ecosystem in southeast China, to examine the temporal variability of NME across time scales and its contribution to net radiative forcing. The results indicated that (a) this ecosystem acted as a CH4 source in most months with the summer accounting for about two\u2010thirds of annual NME of 0.40\u2009g C m\u22122\u2009yr\u22121; (b) the inclusion of annual NME increased the sustained\u2010flux global warming potentials (SGWPs) by 11.0% from 219.3 (CO2 only) to 243.4\u2009g CO2\u2010eq. m\u22122\u2009yr\u22121 for a 100\u2010yr time horizon; (c) NME and its radiative contribution varied across seasons, farming periods, and growth stages, with the temporal fluctuations mainly controlled by temperature and tidal activities; (d) bimodal varying patterns across tidal levels were identified with larger fluxes occurring when tidal level changed most rapidly. This is the first EC study to confirm that CH4 emission intensifies the warming effect of CO2 efflux from macroalgae aquaculture ecosystems. The observed strong temporal variability of CH4 and CO2 fluxes and their asynchrony highlight the importance of high\u2010frequency and continuous flux measurements in accurately assessing their net radiative forcing at both short\u2010 and long\u2010term scales."

However, there is strikingly limited empirical evidence for the environmental and ecological impacts of decommissioning. Here, we employed a meta\u2010analytical approach on an industry benthic monitoring database to investigate the benthic biodiversity and food web properties of structures sampled in the short term (<\u20091\u2009yr; scenario 1), medium term (1\u20135\u2009yr; scenario 2), and long term (>\u20095\u2009yr; scenario 3) after decommissioning. We found reduced species richness and simplified food webs in scenario 1, followed by the first signs of recovery in scenario 2, with a slightly higher proportion of intermediate species and density of food web connections. Food webs recovered further in scenario 3, with a much greater density of interactions, but also more links and longer food chains, while a reduction in generalism and connectance indicated an increased prevalence of specialist species. Our findings demonstrate disturbance risks associated with the decommissioning process in the short term, but a positive recovery trajectory over longer timescales. We highlight the importance of industry collecting more extensive and long\u2010term data at multiple time points and covering different decommissioning types, establishing a standardized data workflow for integrating with available monitoring efforts, and improving stakeholder participation and data accessibility to support an environmentally sound decommissioning process."

    "content": "Abstract\nAntarctica is a seasonally active region for marine organic sulfur cycling and ocean\u2010atmospheric sulfur fluxes. Organic sulfur compounds, such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylsulfide, produced by microbes are key chemical currencies in interspecies interactions, which in turn, underpin marine sulfur dynamics. This study examined Antarctic phytoplankton\u2010bacteria associations and their influence on marine sulfur cycling along a coastal gradient from an inner fjord of the S\u00f8rsdal glacier to the open ocean (six sites). Phytoplankton abundance increased with distance from the glacier, corresponding with an increase in dimethylsulfoniopropionate concentrations (dissolved 13\u201328\u2009nM; total 73\u2013140\u2009nM) and phytoplankton dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity. Microbial community composition varied with glacial\u2010influence, and overall abundance declined with distance from the glacier. We identified strong associations between dominant phytoplankton genera (Cylindrotheca, Corethron, Chaetoceros, Fragilariopsis, Leptocylindrus/Dactyliosolen, and Phaeocystis) and bacteria from the Rhodobacteraceae (i.e., Roseobacter group), highlighting the prevalence of these species' complexes in Antarctic waters. Specifically, pigment markers of Phaeocystis sp. and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to Octadecabacter and Sulfitobacter correlated positively with dissolved dimethylsulfoniopropionate concentrations and phytoplankton dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity, supporting their role in marine sulfur metabolism and extending the known geographical range of sulfur\u2010mediated phytoplankton associations with the Roseobacter group. In broadening the reported range of these interorganism interactions to Antarctic waters, these results extend the prevalence and weight of the role of sulfur\u2010based dependencies in structuring marine microbial communities."

    "content": "Microbial biotechnology has the potential to address several societal issues through the sustainable production of industrially relevant compounds. Despite decades of successful cases, rational engineering of microbial metabolism is still a complex process due to the fine balance between nutrient supply, allocation of cellular resources, energy demand and redox balancing. In this work, we implemented a text-mining workflow for metabolic engineering and compiled a database of experimentally validated strain design strategies from over 15.000 research articles, which includes information on host strain, target compounds, and gene modifications. This large dataset reveals trends on the selection of suitable hosts for different kinds of products and the respective gene targets. Despite the wide variety of microbes and products, we observe a conserved set of target metabolic genes associated with central carbon metabolism, especially in upper glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway, citric acid cycle, and fermentative pathways. The most distinguishing feature among strain design strategies seems not to be which genes are targeted, but rather the direction in which they are modified (increased or decreased expression). Controlling flux at key branching points and redox balancing reactions is thus a critical engineering step to steer metabolism. Our collection of 25 years of literature can provide a stepping stone for starting new strain design projects without reinventing the wheel."

    "content": "Pattern formation underlies organization and function across biological systems. A major challenge in understanding and controlling these systems lies in making accurate, photorealistic predictions of emergent patterns that reflect both the governing biophysical rules and the fine-scaled visual features observed experimentally. Such predictions are essential for interpreting experimental observations and for guiding rational design in contexts where patterning governs system behavior, such as microbial consortia, tissue morphogenesis, and spatially structured biomanufacturing. Mechanistic models can reproduce global morphological patterns but lack visual details; purely data-driven generative models produce visually plausible images that are not grounded in underlying biology. Here, we introduce a simulation-templated hybrid framework that integrates a coarse-grained, mechanistic model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colony expansion with components of a foundation image model. Using this approach, we achieve, for the first time, computationally efficient and experimentally realistic predictions of self-organized bacterial branching patterns, including fine details such as colony texture, color gradients, and replicate level variability. By combining mechanistic simulations with the expressive power of a foundation image model, our strategy offers a generalizable path for simulation-templated photorealistic prediction of biological patterns, with applications across synthetic biology, tissue morphogenesis, and other spatially structured biological and physical systems."

    "content": "Polylactic acid (PLA) is a polymer that is known to exhibit compostability at thermophilic temperatures, and this activity is thought to be connected to the presence of PLA hydrolyzability in environmental microbes. We recently developed a set of compost that can biodegrade PLA at mesophilic conditions, and one possible reason underlying our success could be due to the enrichment of PLA hydrolyzability. Here, we investigated the potential selection of bioactivities related to PLA breakdown in our trained compost and surveyed the occurrences of those activities in the environment for comparison. Ten different environments were sampled, including PLA, larval gut of black soldier flies, and organic material from our trained compost, as well as terrestrial soil, estuarine sediment, brackish water, shell biofilm, coastal stranded polystyrene, bottle, and bottle cap. We found a small fraction of cultivable bacteria in many samples that harbored PLA degradability. For our trained compost, PLA-degrading isolates were twice as efficient as those from other environments, even though the frequency at which they were detected was not significantly higher. These findings suggested that PLA breakdown ability is commonly present at a low percentage in most environments, and that our trained compost has been able to select for more effective isolates. As this enhancement is likely insufficient to explain the increase in PLA compostability in our trained compost compared to standard mesophilic composts, we propose that additional microbial activities are needed to act synergistically and overcome the requirement for elevated temperature in PLA composting."

    "content": "Background: Dental caries is the most common chronic oral disease in children, but its etiology is complex and multifactorial. The association of the oral microbiota with caries is underexplored in children. We investigated saliva microbiota in Finnish children and aimed to identify microbial biomarkers associated with the risk of having caries or fillings (CF). Methods: We examined 400 Finnish children (180 girls, 220 boys) aged 7-9 years who provided stimulated saliva samples and underwent clinical oral examinations at baseline of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study. Of these children, 261 (65%) were with CF and 139 (35%) were without CF. We characterized the saliva microbiota using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, examined differences in the abundance and composition at the phylum and genus level between these two groups, and studied the associations of selected Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with the risk of having CF in crude and adjusted (OTUs, age, Silness-Loe plaque index) models. Results: Alpha diversity and richness did not differ between the groups (p>0.1 for Shannon, inverse Simpson, and Chao1 indices) in the total sample nor when analyzed among girls and boys separately. Beta diversity differed between the groups in the total sample, and when girls and boys were analyzed separately (p corrected by false discovery rate method [pcorr] ~ 0.001). In total, 80 OTUs differed between the groups at the genus level (pcorr<0.01). Two OTUs were independently associated with the risk of having CF. A novel Parvimonas OTU was inversely associated with having CF (odds ratio [ORcrude] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.75). In addition, an OTU of probably Streptococcus mutans was positively associated with having CF (ORcrude 6.01, 95% CI 3.49 to 10.36). Conclusion: A Parvimonas species represented by a novel OTU is independently and inversely associated with the risk of having CF in children."

    "content": "Onset and progression of active tuberculosis disease result from upsetting the delicate balance between Mtb virulence and host defenses. Because it dynamically tunes the functional output of protein expression in cells, alternative splicing, a process by which different mRNAs can be generated from a single gene, is positioned to play a critical role in maintaining an equilibrated Mtb-macrophage host-pathogen interface. To gain insight into how alternative splicing shapes antimycobacterial immune responses, we used RNA-sequencing and splicing-aware computational pipelines to quantify alternative splicing in Mtb-infected bone marrow-derived murine macrophages. We found that ~5% of expressed macrophage genes exhibit one or more splicing changes at 8h post-Mtb infection, highlighting alternative splicing as a key regulatory node in the macrophage response to Mtb. We next sought to identify RNA binding proteins that play an outsized role in shaping the macrophage transcriptome during Mtb infection. We discovered that the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) promotes the early induction of inflammatory genes while dampening several type I interferon-stimulated genes in response to Mtb. HnRNPA2B1 also controls alternative splicing of many genes during Mtb infection, including Irgm1, a critical immunity-related GTPase. The balance of Irgm1-long vs. -short is differentially regulated in response to diverse inflammatory cues and macrophages overexpressing Irgm1-short are defective in autophagosomal targeting, lysosomal homeostasis, and restriction of Mtb replication. These data highlight a key role for AS in shaping the macrophage transcriptome and pinpoint hnRNPA2B1 as a novel restriction factor in the cell-intrinsic response to Mtb."

    "content": "The overuse of antibiotics in livestock is leading to the development of super-resistant pathogens, necessitating the production of probiotic feed for livestock that is also sustainable. Therefore, the study aims to ferment five mixtures of black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) and soy in different proportions with the probiotic Lactobacillus bulgaricus in order to determine which allows the greatest growth of this probiotic bacteria and represent a new feed alternative for sustainable livestock farming. To achieve this, the growth curve of Lactobacillus bulgaricus in MRS broth was determined. In the exponential growth phase, this broth was added to the five formulations of BSFLM and soy, and finally, the CFU produced by each formulation was determined. It was found that the concentration of BSFLM has a statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) on the concentration of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, with twice as many CFU of the probiotic obtained in the pure HLMSN treatment than in the pure soy treatment. These results reveal that Lactobacillus bulgaricus is capable of metabolizing and producing greater biomass with BSFLM as a substrate instead of soy, so this formulation can be used in subsequent studies for in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial testing."

    "content": "Poly(A) tails are present on most cellular and viral mRNAs, providing a platform for poly(A)-binding proteins that stimulate translation and regulate the deadenylation and stability of transcripts in the cytoplasm. Here we leverage nanopore direct RNA sequencing to analyse the distribution of poly(A) tail lengths on cellular and viral mRNAs across Herpesviridae and other DNA and RNA virus infections. We find that herpesvirus mRNA poly(A) tails are consistently longer than those on cellular and other viral transcripts, presenting a previously unrecognized yet widespread mechanism to advantage herpesviral gene expression. This contrasts with the templated poly(A) tails on coronavirus RNAs and those on cytoplasmically transcribed poxviral mRNAs, which are more similar in length to those on host mRNAs. Herpesviral noncoding RNAs display differential poly(A) tailing patterns which do not correlate with nuclear localisation while individual herpesviral mRNAs also show variation in the extent to which their poly(A) tail lengths change during the virus lifecycle, suggestive of additional uncharacterised layers of poly(A) tail length regulation. Importantly, while we detect non-adenosine nucleotides within herpesviral poly(A) tails, which are known to oppose deadenylase activity, this mixed tailing is not at sufficient frequency to explain the widespread extended tails of herpesvirus mRNAs."

Their production extends beyond the Mediterranean basin and the transformation of different olive varieties according to various trade preparations results in high product diversity. Several varieties have Protected Designation of Origin, and, in Italy the black naturally fermented Oliva di Gaeta is prominent. In order to understand the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities and how it is affected by olive variety, olive ripeness and trade preparation, we carried out a survey using 364 samples from 40 producers and 6 countries. We measured pH, salt concentration, viable counts and carried out amplicon targeted metagenomics of bacterial and fungal communities. Olive variety, olive ripeness and trade preparation all significantly affected the diversity and composition of bacterial and fungal communities but dispersal plays a confounding role: even within the same variety we found significant differences between producing firms and a large variability even within the same firm. This may be due to limited control of contamination (with house microbiota playing a role in initial contamination events) and of technological factors and also to the widespread use of relatively small fermenters (240-280 L). This variability obscured the differences that existed between PDO (Oliva di Gaeta) and non PDO (Itrana nera) black naturally fermented olives of the Itrana variety. Nonetheless, we were able to identify subset of bacterial and fungal genera which were differentially abundant in selected trade preparations and confirmed that the diversity of lactic acid bacteria communities of naturally fermented olives."

    "content": "Mycobacterium abscessus is a drug-resistant pathogen associated with poor clinical outcomes despite treatment with multidrug antibiotic regimens. Apart from clarithromycin, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results for Mycobacterium abscessus cannot guide antibiotic selection. AST involves measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is allowed to span a four-fold range in concentration. This accepted variability of the MIC limits the clinical utility of AST. Antimicrobial dose-response curves, obtained by measuring the growth inhibition of a given organism to increasing concentrations of an antibiotic, can yield metrics of antibiotic activity that are less variable than the MIC. We used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute growth conditions for rapid-grower nontuberculous mycobacteria to generate 990 dose-response curves across three time points (72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours) for six guideline-recommended (clarithromycin, amikacin, cefoxitin, linezolid, tigecycline, and clofazimine) and five new (omadacycline, tedizolid, SPR719, SQ109, and bedaquiline) antibiotics against Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies abscessus ATCC 19977 and Mycobacterium peregrinum ATCC 700686. We established the fit of the dose-response curve (R2) as a quality control metric. Using the geometric standard deviation and median coefficient of variation, we demonstrated that the IC50 and IC75 (antibiotic concentrations corresponding to 50% and 75% growth inhibition, respectively) are less variable than the MIC. We identified time-dependent changes in dose-response curve metrics that allow the detection of inducible clarithromycin resistance with only five days of incubation. This study demonstrates the potential of dose-response curves in measuring antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium abscessus."

Yet, a holistic understanding of the impact of different succession stage on the karst soil microbiome is still poorly understood. Here, we used a field experiment to investigate the long-term consequences of changes in succession stage: rocky desertification(RD), grassland(GL), shrubs(SH), forest plantation(FP) and natural forest(NF)  based on plant frequency on bacteria, protist and fungal communities. We showed that the shannon index of bacteria and fungi were higher in NF compared to GL, while protist shannon index was higher in SH that GL. The bacterial simpson_e index in NF and PF were higher than that in GL, SH and RD, howerer fungal and protist simpson_e index were similar across the five succession stages. Significant differences were observed in observed outs and phylogenetic diversity index in NF, SH were higher than GL, RD for fungi and protist, whereas bacterial observed outs and phylogenetic diversity index were relatively similar in five succession stage. The five succession stage differed markedly in the compositions of bacterial, fungi and protist communities. In bacterial, dominant phyla were Actinobacteriota, Proteoprotist, Acidobacteriota. Protist communities were dominated by Phragmoplastophyta, Arthropoda phyla. Regarding protist taxa, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Our findings provided evidence indicating that the microbial community compositions of RD, GL, SH, PF, and NF have their respective characteristics. These characteristics stem from differences in vegetation coverage, plant debris, root formation and other factors, leading to changes in the diversity and taxonomic group of bacteria, fungi and protists at different successional stages. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive perspective, showing the differences in microbial communities at different successional stages in karst soil."

By combining longitudinal sampling and analysis of Enterobacterales and associated phages isolated from the human gut, with experimental evolution, our work identifies mechanisms that underpin observed patterns of temperate phage-bacteria co-existence and bacterial resistance in this clinically relevant microbiome. Specifically, we show that limited phage infectivity observed against sympatric and allopatric hosts can be explained by the prevalence of spontaneous prophage induction (SPI) bacterial phenotypes and ecological shifts and turnover in focal host populations at multiple taxonomic levels. Despite the ubiquity of temperate phages in the human gut, these findings challenge the assumption that they are major drivers of within-host bacterial evolution and diversification over short-time scales in this natural ecosystem."

Here we cross two genetically distinct but highly syntenic sympatric strains of Sulfolobus (Saccharolobus) islandicus and identify the pattern of recombination across the archaeal chromosome. We quantify recombination breakpoints occurring at neutral chromosomal markers through high-throughput short read Illumina sequencing of selected recombinant strains. We focus on three datasets that provide different, but corroborating information: i) individual colony sequences, ii) large colony pools of strains sorted by background genotype, and iii) a large colony pool of combined background genotypes. For each dataset we apply a newly designed and optimized computational tool called MARBL (Multiply Anchored Recombination Breakpoint Locator) for quantifying breakpoints and testing their statistical significance relative to sources of error introduced by sequencing technology. By combining the results of each dataset, we determine the short tract recombination preference in this organism and discuss its implications for mechanisms of recombination in archaea. We demonstrate uniform rates of recombination throughout the chromosome, which differ from previous studies of natural variation and discuss this in light of previous data suggesting speciation occurs through selection against inter-species hybrids."

Reverse transcriptase-associated defense systems of the UG family are widespread across bacterial lineages, yet their ecological roles remain largely undefined. Within this family, UG5 systems are distinguished by reverse transcriptases fused to or associated with a nitrilase domain. Here, we combine phylogenetic, metagenomic, and functional analyses to investigate the evolutionary context and antiviral activity of UG5-associated sys-tems. Phylogenetic analysis of 728 nitrilase domains places UG5-associated ni-trilases within a well-supported UG-related radiation encompassing the UG1, UG5, and UG6 families, with UG1 nested within a broader UG5 lineage. Meta-genomic analysis further revealed UG5-associated reverse transcriptases in soil- and rhizosphere-derived metagenomes. Based on this observation, we character-ized a UG5-large RT-associated system, here designated DRT11, encoded on the pSymA megaplasmid of Sinorhizobium meliloti RMO17, a nitrogen-fixing symbi-ont of Medicago sativa. Despite lacking the transmembrane protein typical of ca-nonical UG5-large architectures, DRT11 confers protection against naturally oc-curring M. sativa rhizosphere phages with Podoviridae-like morphology. Phage infection assays reveal protection at low multiplicities of infection, consistent with an abortive-infection-like mechanism. Moreover, mutational analyses demonstrate that antiviral activity requires only the RT and its fused C-terminal nitrilase do-main, establishing DRT11 as a minimal UG5-associated antiviral system."

In this context, Universal-Bac3Gel represents a new generation of 3D biomaterials designed to mimic the properties of human mucus and biofilm features, including micro-gradients that replicate the heterogeneous environments colonized by microorganisms in the human body. To evaluate the suitability of Universal-Bac3Gel for studying clinically relevant species in antimicrobial resistance, the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae) were cultured within this 3D environment. Bacterial growth was monitored at 24- and 48-hours post-inoculation via spot plating, while viability, distribution and organization were assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. All ESKAPE strains successfully grew throughout the structure of Universal-Bac3Gel. Distinct 3D biofilm architectures were observed across species, ranging from diffuse colonization to compact microcolony formation, in agreement with species-specific biofilm patterns. Notably, the platform's ready-to-use 96-well format allowed direct comparison of these high-priority pathogens under identical conditions, highlighting species-specific biofilm traits that would be difficult to discern in traditional 2D or animal models. This work highlights the versatility of Universal-Bac3Gel as a platform for studying pathogen colonization under a biofilm-relevant environment and underscores its potential for translational applications, including antimicrobial drug testing, personalized medicine, and reduction of animal model use in preclinical research."

    "content": "Background The mosquito gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining its capacity to transmit harmful viruses and parasites. Accordingly, manipulating mosquito gut microbiota is a promising avenue toward reducing mosquito-borne human pathogen transmission. A successful microbial control campaign will require a thorough understanding of how bacteria are transmitted through mosquito populations. Through two parallel but complementary studies using the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti as a focal host species, we surveyed vertical transmission of bacteria from individual mothers to cohorts of offspring maintained in a closed system. Results Laboratory- and field-derived mothers deposited bacteria that support offspring development, and the relative abundance of commonly transmitted taxa correlated with offspring fitness. Maternally transmitted bacteria were detected in both larval and adult offspring, and the relative abundances of specific taxa differed between life stages. Microbiota composition in adult offspring closely resembled microbiota composition in mothers, despite dramatic shifts in the relative abundance of specific microbial community members during the larval stage. Variability in microbiota composition in offspring was also greater than variability across the population of egg-laying mothers. Eggs that underwent a period of desiccation before hatching produced larval communities dominated by endospore-forming bacteria that were rare in maternal samples. Conclusions Overall, our results demonstrate the vertical transmission of mosquito-associated microbiota across generations, including bacterial taxa that could potentially be leveraged for mosquito and mosquito-borne disease control."

We investigated several routes of MPXV Clade IIb virus infection (intranasal, oral, anal, and intraperitoneal) and found high and prolonged viral titres in the testes after IP inoculation still detectable at 21 days. The testes had significant changes to tissue architecture including loss of spermatogenesis, disorganization of spermatozoa, loss of Leydig cells, and breakdown of the seminiferous tubule membranes. Viral antigen positive cells were present in the interstitial spaces between the seminiferous tubules with macrophage infiltration also evident.

Concerns of HPAIV causing high mortality of seabirds and mammals prompted immediate efforts to track its spread and impact on endemic wildlife. In March 2024, we visited the Danger Islands archipelago, that hosts two mega-colonies of Adelie penguins, and observed an unusual mortality estimated in thousands of Adelie penguins and other species. Swabs and tissues were collected for molecular detection of infectious agents from 49 carcasses, and additional tissues for histology from a selection of 9 carcasses. We unexpectedly detected Pasteurella multocida DNA in 46 of 49 individuals, and diagnosed avian cholera, and not HPAI, as the cause of death of most of these animals. By metagenomics, we retrieved the genomic sequences of the Pasteurella multocida strain which caused the epizootic, and the phylogenetic analysis showed a close relation with strains previously reported in the Southern Ocean area. This study confirms avian cholera as a relevant cause of mortality in the Antarctic region, and overall highlights the importance of considering avian cholera in the differential diagnoses during mortality events in Antarctica, even with the concurrent circulation of HPAIV."

Recently, dietary interventions targeted at restoring microbial balance have therefore gained attention as potential therapeutic strategies. We recently demonstrated that an encapsulated synbiotic containing high-oleic palm oil and Limosilactobacillus fermentum K73 can modulate the metabolic activity and composition of human-derived gut microbiota in an in vitro batch bioreactor. Here, we extended this work through an in vivo supplementation pilot study using gnotobiotic mice colonized with gut microbiota from Colombian pediatric patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or age-matched neurotypical (NT) donors. Behavioral assessments and analyses of gut microbiota composition and function were performed before and after synbiotic supplementation. First, we found that the gut microbiota from Colombian ASD patients exhibited significantly reduced richness relative to NT donors, consistent with reports from other geographical regions, and displayed distinct compositional features unique to this population. Humanization of the gnotobiotic mice with this donor microbiota was successful, with murine gut communities reflecting features of their corresponding donor microbiota. Notably, synbiotic supplementation induced significant increases in the abundance of beneficial taxa and the production of short chain fatty acids that were more pronounced in mice colonized with ASD-derived microbiota, with concurrent behavioral changes associated with beneficial modulation of gut microbiota. Overall, we provide evidence that supports synbiotic supplementation as a viable strategy to positively modulate gut microbiome in conditions of dysbiosis. Our study also expands the body of knowledge of gut microbiome to understudied populations such as Latin America."

Using a radial diffusion assay and resazurin-based viability testing, C14R exhibited potent bactericidal effect with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits visible growth of planktonic microorganisms, ranging from 3.4 {micro}g/mL (Enterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant) to 45.2 {micro}g/mL (Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, ESBL). C14R also inhibited biofilm formation by Gram-positive pathogens, with minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs), referring to the minimal concentration required to prevent the development of biofilms, of 15.0 {micro}g/mL (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) and 22.0 {micro}g/mL (E. faecium, VRE), whereas Gram-negatives biofilms showed higher tolerance.

    "content": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome. Conserved sequence elements within the 5'- and 3'-non-coding regions (NCRs) of the CHIKV genome interact with host proteins to regulate viral RNA replication. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and mass spectrometry identified several host RNA-binding proteins that associate with these conserved NCR elements, among which EWSR1 uniquely bound the 3'-ends of both the plus-sense genomic RNA and the minus-sense replication intermediate RNA. EMSA and biolayer interferometry demonstrated that EWSR1 binds strongly to two RNA elements: a 48-nucleotide region in the plus-strand 3'-NCR (3NCR48) and a 50-nucleotide region at the 3'-end of the minus-strand replication intermediate (5NCR-RC50), which is complementary to the genome's 5'-NCR and its adjacent sequence. RNA immunoprecipitation from CHIKV-infected cells confirmed that EWSR1 binds CHIKV RNA in vivo. Functional analyses revealed that CHIKV infection downregulates EWSR1 expression and causes its cytoplasmic accumulation. Knockdown or knockout of EWSR1 expression increased CHIKV genomic RNA levels and viral titers, whereas its overexpression suppressed both. EWSR1 reduced the synthesis of both plus- and minus-sense CHIKV RNAs in infected cells. Additionally, EWSR1 was found to bind CHIKV nsP2 and inhibit its helicase activity, which is critical for viral genome replication. The antiviral activity of EWSR1 extended to Ross River virus but not to Sindbis virus, consistent with conservation of the 48-nucleotide sequence in their respective 3'-NCRs. Together, these findings identify EWSR1 as a novel host restriction factor that limits CHIKV replication through specific interactions with viral RNA and the nsP2 protein."

    "content": "The human pathogenic orthoflavivirus St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) reemerged in the western United States in 2015 after more than a decade of apparent absence and has since expanded throughout California with sustained, interannual transmission. This shift from the historically sporadic pattern of SLEV activity prior to 2003 raises the question of whether contemporary SLEV strains differ in fitness in Culex vectors compared with earlier strains. To determine whether reemerging SLEV possess augmented infectivity and transmissibility that may have facilitated reestablishment, we compared the vector competence of five genotype III SLEV strains detected in California between 2016 and 2023 with a historic genotype V strain from 2003. Laboratory colonies of the two primary California vectors, Culex (Cx.) tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus, were orally exposed to bloodmeals containing 3, 5, or 6.7 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL of SLEV, and infection, dissemination, and transmission were assessed 13-14 days later by quantifying SLEV RNA in individual mosquitoes. Both species exhibited strong dose-dependent responses, with minimal infection at 3 log10 PFU/mL and uniformly high infection, dissemination, and saliva positivity at 6.7 log10 PFU/mL. At 5 log10 PFU/mL, genotype III strains infected Cx. quinquefasciatus more efficiently than the historical 2003 strain, which failed to infect this species. In Cx. tarsalis, fitness differences among SLEV strains were more modest and strain-specific. These findings demonstrate that multiple genotype III SLEV strains exhibit equal or greater vector infectivity in Cx. quinquefasciatus than the 2003 genotype V strain, suggesting that enhanced fitness in this vector may contribute to the persistence and geographic spread of SLEV in California since its reemergence and underscoring the need for continued vector surveillance and targeted control efforts to reduce SLEV transmission to humans."

In this study, we quantified feeder use in the Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) from a population in Central Spain using radio frequency identification (RFID) with the aim of unravelling its determinants and consequences. We found extensive variation in feeder use, both individually and temporally. Individuals that made use of feeders later spent more time feeding. Feeder use did not explain variation in reproductive success in our population. Our study indicates that inter-individual differences combined with seasonality are the main determinants of feeder use."

    "content": "Introduction: Timing of birth is a major determinant of individuals reproductive success and survival, and is driven by multiple internal and external factors. However, there is currently no quantitative assessment of the extent and support received by the drivers of the phenology of births in mammals. Due to their diverse phenology of births, large herbivores represent an ideal case study to quantify this. Aims: our objective was to identify the different drivers tested for their effect on the phenology of births in large herbivores and how much empirical support they received, as well as determine thematic, taxonomic and spatial gaps in the literature. Methods: We conducted a systematic review focusing on the drivers of the phenology of births in wild large herbivores. We extracted the outcomes of 124 relevant articles and assessed the reliability of their findings using a general index based on the quality of the data and methods used. Results and Discussion: As expected, the two dominant hypotheses (seasonality and predation) received strong support regarding their effect on birth timing and synchrony, respectively. The effect of female, offspring and population characteristics remained marginally accounted for, even though there was evidence of their importance in the determination of the phenology of births. We identified a major research gap in Asian and South and Central American species. Conclusions: We encourage research in these understudied domains, as well as large scale multi-species comparative analyses to fill in the gaps and improve our understanding of reproductive phenology."

    "content": "Latitudinal changes in environmental conditions shape the evolution of avian life history traits: tropical bird species typically exhibiting prolonged breeding seasons, a slower pace of life, lower annual investment in reproduction and increased annual survival compared to their temperate counterparts. Major shifts in physiology, reflecting these differences, are expected to be mediated by endocrine regulation, yet comparative data on the sources of inter-specific variation in hormone concentrations remain sparse, especially outside the Nearctic-Neotropic system. We examined variation in two key steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, across 100 passerine species from Europe and the Afrotropics, sampled using standardized field protocols. Baseline levels of both hormones were consistently lower in tropical species, as expected. While stress-induced corticosterone reactivity did not differ between latitudes, it declined with migration distance. Testosterone levels were higher in males than females and declined with migration distance. In tropical species, neither hormone was associated with elevation, another source of environmental variation, but both varied during the breeding cycle, challenging the view of tropical aseasonality. This study broadens the perspective on endocrine correlates of avian life history evolution by testing their generality in an understudied Afrotropical-Palearctic system. The results support the hypothesis that steroid hormone profiles co-evolve with latitude."

    "content": "Rosewoods account for up to 40% of the global illegal wildlife trade, with Dalbergia cochinchinensis (Siamese rosewood) being the most heavily exploited species in Southeast Asia. Its survival is further threatened by intensifying drought linked to climate change and hydrological alteration. Here we combine greenhouse drought experiments across six provenances with full-length cDNA-seq to uncover how water-relations and carbon-use strategies vary within this species. Multivariate trait analysis resolves a two-dimensional isohydry space: a water-flux stringency axis (gs-E) largely orthogonal to a carbon-economics axis (A-WUEi). Provenances differed strikingly, where two (KKH, DN) showed a rare E{downarrow}A{uparrow} response, achieving high WUEi and maintaining growth under drought. Contrary to expectation, precipitation of the wettest month, not the driest, predicted isohydry, indicating that wet-season conditions set a developmental and hydrological floor for later drought responses. We identified 76 drought-responsive genes and two genes associated with isohydry axes, a poorly characterised Notch-like protein, AT4G14746, and SEOR1. We also detected provenance-specific isoform switches, where drought favoured a PRX52 isoform lacking its signal peptide in the anisohydric provenance THB, and functional coding isoforms of ANN3 and LTPG5 in NP. These results reveal previously hidden diversity in drought strategies, identify mechanism-anchored markers for screening, and provide a simple climatic lever for climate-adjusted provenancing. We reveal post-transcriptional regulation as a novel candidate substrate for local adaptation in a threatened tropical tree, directly linking ecophysiology, climate and genomes for conservation and restoration."

    "content": "Tracing the introduction, spread, and evolution of non-native species is crucial for risk assessment and management. Spiders represent one of the largest groups of terrestrial arthropod predators, and an increasing number of species have been introduced globally, posing growing challenges to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Yet, their global introduction routes, spatial diversity patterns, and evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a global-scale survey of 53,172 taxon records and updated the checklist of North American spiders to 5,401 species, including 118 non-native species. By integrating historical records with species occurrence data, we reconstructed the geographic origins of non-native species and found that most originated from Asia and Europe, consistent with long-standing transcontinental trade and intensive human activities. Mapping the contemporary distributions of all non-native species revealed at least six richness hotspots, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas, underscoring strong associations between non-native spider accumulation and population density, trade intensity, and human-mediated dispersal pathways. By analyzing genomes of 45 native and five non-native spider species within North America, we detected a set of metabolic, stress tolerance and immune defense genes under positive selection and rapid evolution in non-native species, suggesting that putative functional innovations may contribute to their establishment, expansion, and ongoing local adaptation. Altogether, our study provides the most comprehensive survey to date of introduction routes, spatial dynamics, and evolutionary signatures of non-native spiders in North America, and highlights putative mechanisms that may facilitate arthropod introductions under global change."

    "content": "Automated detection and classification of species vocalisations offers the potential to utilise acoustic datasets across unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, classification algorithms inevitably generate errors, and error rates vary with context. While methods for quantifying error rates in ecoacoustics are well established, there is limited research on what level of model performance is sufficient to reliably determine avian vocalisation patterns. Using an extensive fully expert-labelled acoustic dataset from Peru (18 hours, 6 sites), we examined changes in the probability of detecting target bird vocalisations in the first hour after dawn to address three key questions: (1) How sensitive are models predicting detection probability over time to reductions in classification accuracy? (2) To what extent does aggregating detections over longer time periods impact classification accuracy? Additionally, we used the labelled dataset to assess how the creation and composition of a test dataset for assessing classifier performance can impact the reliability of accuracy metrics: (3) Are estimates of classification precision robust when test and deployment datasets are not independent and identically distributed? Our results indicate that poor classification performance - especially low precision - can lead to misleading inferences about temporal patterns of vocalisations. Aggregating classifier predictions over longer time periods improved recall but often resulted in misleading patterns of vocal behaviour by reducing precision and temporal resolution. We also demonstrate that precision can be substantially overestimated when species presences are rarer in the deployment dataset than in test data. These findings highlight the importance of cautious application of automated classification in acoustic ecology and the need for accuracy assessment methods tailored to the intended ecological analysis."

    "content": "Life history is key to understanding macroecological patterns. Measurable characteristics are particularly critical to the study of ecology. These quantifiable traits can be compared between numerous taxonomic clades to examine how evolutionary forces have shaped biological systems. Although numerous in-depth studies have focused on assessing the life histories of mammalian and avian taxa, few scientific endeavors have addressed the diversity of measurable reproductive characteristics in other vertebrate clades. Here we present the first work examine the macroecology of life history traits in serpentine reptiles and amphibians. Both chosen clades comprise taxa that are limbless, predatory, and primarily restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes. To test the hypothesis that phylogeny limits the extent to which life-history may overlap, the body mass, lifespan, hatchling size, and clutch size of serpentine amphibians and reptiles will be compared using statistical inference methods (t-tests). The distributions of body mass, lifespan, hatchling size, and clutch size differ among serpentine reptiles and amphibians. Linear models suggest that how hatchling and clutch size vary with body mass also differ between the two. Only the linear model examining how lifespan varies with body mass indicates that broad similarities in life histories exist between serpentine amphibians and reptiles. Our results, that little overlap exists in life-history, suggest that the same macroevolutionary processes that allow serpentine amphibian and reptile ecological niche regimes to converge are not acting on their quantifiable life-history traits."

    "content": "Culex mosquitoes are important vectors of West Nile virus, and, as small-bodied ectotherms, are sensitive to temperature. This is especially important for juvenile stages which are confined to the body of water where they hatched and are unable to relocate for thermoregulation. In an urban desert like Maricopa County, Arizona, the macroclimate is strongly influenced by the urban heat island effect where larval thermal maxima are frequently exceeded. Understanding the local temperatures (microclimates) of sites that mosquitoes chose for egg-laying and larval development is important for managing mosquito populations and reducing disease risk. We deployed small temperature loggers at multiple breeding sites throughout the city and compared those temperatures to gridded reanalysis macroclimate data. We found that the recorded aquatic microclimates were consistently cooler than corresponding macroclimates, and that higher canopy cover further buffered hot temperatures. This suggests that using interpolated macroclimate data to estimate mosquito population dynamics overestimates the thermal stress local mosquitoes actually experience. By using microclimate measures we can better predict mosquito survival and development, allowing us to better understand disease risk both now and with future warming."

    "content": "Understanding variation in age at maturity is important for endangered species recovery because older, larger adults contribute disproportionately to the next generation. Conditions in early life stages may have underappreciated impacts on age at maturity. Our study objective was to associate adult age of individually tagged wild, spring/summer Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) outmigrating from the Snake River (Idaho and Washington, USA) in 1998-2020 with covariates measured during juvenile and subadult stages. We used a hierarchical Bayesian ordinal probit regression model to estimate statistical effects of juvenile body length, seasonal migration timing or river temperature, transported or in-river hydrosystem passage, river flow, and a large-scale ocean index. Results indicated notable carryover effects consistent with underlying biological mechanisms related to growth and development, in which shorter juvenile length and later seasonal migration timing were associated with older adults. These biological and behavioural factors were more important than riverine or marine environmental conditions examined. Our study suggests that managers and decision makers should consider carryover effects from the juvenile life stage on age structure in conjunction with survival."

    "content": "The increase in the frequency and severity of drought-induced tree mortality in many European low-elevation forests poses considerable challenges to forest management and requires an understanding of its causes. We propose a novel framework for integrating the factors underlying drought-induced tree mortality in a dynamic vegetation model. We evaluate whether this framework accurately reproduces drought-related mortality in six mesic beech-dominated stands in 2018-2020, and over multiple years in a xeric Scots pine-dominated stand in Switzerland. Additionally, we investigate its behavior along a large climatic gradient in central Europe. We employ a three-step approach. First, we evaluate multiple drought indices for capturing tree growth responses to extreme drought. We find that in contrast to widespread indices such as SPI and SPEI, the ForClim drought index captures growth responses to drought intensity during summer, the growing period, and annually. Second, we assess in detail the capability of the ForClim soil moisture model to simulate soil water dynamics, comparing it to the mechanistic soil-vegetation-atmosphere model LWFBrook90. The ForClim soil moisture model adequately simulates soil water dynamics, particularly in extreme drought years. Third, based on Manion Decline Disease Theory, we develop a novel mortality sub-model that combines predisposing and inciting factors. Its integration in ForClim captures drought-induced mortality events in the mesic beech forests as well as the multi-year mortality at the xeric Scots pine-dominated stand. Along a climatic gradient in central Europe, the model provides good quantifications of Potential Natural Vegetation. The novel framework to capture drought-related tree mortality is simple yet produces accurate results. The underlying hypothesis regarding the factors leading to drought-induced tree mortality is promising but requires further tests for its generality."

However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

But, broadly speaking, today\u2019s robots designed and used for military purposes encompass all areas of robotics, from vehicles travelling on ground, to water and air drones, to camera-guided rifles, and combinations thereof. While most of these systems are not lethal, and are used primarily for surveillance, reconnaissance, and observation, the weaponization of robots is becoming increasingly easier because modern robots are startlingly better than their predecessors at manipulating objects while in motion.

By integrating paleoecological, historical, and climate data, we evaluate how climate and land use shaped peatland hydrology, vegetation, and carbon dynamics. The record reflects regional land\u2010use history, confirming the usefulness of peatbogs as archives of land\u2010use changes. Our profile identifies raised bog hydrology as a part of the surrounding catchment, and we discuss the susceptibility of these ecosystems to climate change. From the start of the record until ca. 700 CE, local agricultural activity was limited. After 700 CE, population growth and deforestation drove ecological instability, marked by reduced carbon accumulation, hydrological change, and increased fire activity. Since \u223c1960 CE, drainage has caused a long\u2010term water table decline and arboreal encroachment. Our results suggest that past land\u2010use changes have greatly affected the peatland ecosystem at Mustj\u00e4rve. Despite this, Mustj\u00e4rve appears to have been very resilient. Although there is no evidence for past critical transitions/thresholds, the current state of the Mustj\u00e4rve peatland suggests high vulnerability, highlighting the importance of contemporary management practices to prevent further disturbances."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe Lansing effect is a transgenerational age effect by which old parents tend to produce less viable descendants. Despite its importance for the evolution of lifespan and parental effects, the transgenerational nature of age effects and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In an experiment using the three\u2010spined stickleback, we test whether the age of mothers (generation P0) at reproduction affects parental traits of the F1 offspring, and whether they subsequently influence the early development and viability of the F2 descendants. Daughters (F1 females) of old (2\u2010year\u2010old) and young (1\u2010year\u2010old) mothers showed comparable body size, spawning rate, clutch size and egg telomere length (TL). However, sons (F1 males) of old mothers had a smaller adult body size and produced sperm with shorter TL than those of younger mothers. Structural equation model analysis revealed that P0 female age influenced embryo TL and hatching success of the F2 descendants through its effect on sperm TL of F1 males. There was also an interacting effect of P0 female age and telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (tert) mRNA level in eggs of the F1 females on the hatching success of the F2 descendants. Our results provide novel evidence that maternal age can have transmissive effects on successive generations through the gamete traits of their offspring, especially sperm TL and egg tert gene transcripts. We conclude that this transmissible age effect on grandoffspring TL and viability can shape the evolution of life histories because TL is related to health, ageing and lifespan."

    "content": "<p>by Rohit Kumar Singh, Pinaki Swain, Mahipal Ganji, Sandeep Choubey</p>\n\nThe compaction of DNA by phase-separating, DNA-binding proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for organizing chromatin and shaping genome architecture. Although experimental studies have provided insights into the governing principles of such protein-mediated DNA compaction, the effect of DNA sequence remains unclear. Here, guided by experimental observations, we present a simple polymer-based model of protein-mediated DNA compaction that explicitly accounts for sequence-dependent protein binding. Using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, in the case of a homogeneous DNA, only one condensate forms in equilibrium. In sharp contrast, DNA sequence heterogeneity can result in the coexistence of multiple condensates. Interestingly, we find that interfacial DNA binding affinity controls capillary forces generated by protein-DNA condensates, offering a potential mechanism to regulate chromatin structure and 3D genome organization. To demonstrate the usefulness of our modeling framework, we compare the simulation results against published data for the compaction of DNA via Dps, Sox2, and HP1. We find that DNA sequence dictates the compaction of Sox2 and HP1 with DNA. Overall, our framework provides mechanistic insights into how DNA sequence affects protein-mediated DNA compaction and paves the way for developing a deeper understanding of genome organization."

    "content": "<p>by Lihao Lin, Francesco Lapi, Bruno Giovanni Galuzzi, Marco Vanoni, Lilia Alberghina, Chiara Damiani</p>\n\nCancer cells undergo extensive metabolic rewiring to support growth, survival, and phenotypic plasticity. A non-canonical variant of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, characterized by mitochondrial-to-cytosolic citrate export, has emerged as critical for embryonic stem cell differentiation. However, its role in cancer remains poorly understood.\nHere, we present a two-step computational framework to systematically analyze the activity of this non-canonical TCA cycle across over 500 cancer cell lines and investigate its role in shaping hallmarks of malignancy. First, we applied constraint-based modeling to infer cycle activity, defining two complementary metrics: <i>Cycle Propensity</i>, measuring the likelihood of its engagement in each cell line, and <i>Cycle Flux Intensity</i>, quantifying average flux through the reaction identified as rate-limiting. We identified distinct tumor-specific patterns of pathway utilization. Notably, cells with high <i>Cycle Propensity</i> preferentially reroute cytosolic citrate via aconitase 1 (ACO1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), promoting \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) and NADPH production. Elevated engagement of this cycle strongly correlated with Warburg-like metabolic shifts, including decreased oxygen consumption and increased lactate secretion.\nIn the second step, to uncover non-metabolic transcriptional signatures associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, we performed machine learning\u2013based feature selection using ElasticNet and XGBoost, identifying robust gene signatures predictive of cycle activity. Over-representation analysis revealed enrichment in genes involved in metastatic behavior, angiogenesis, stemness, and key oncogenic signaling. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) further prioritized genes with the strongest predictive contributions, highlighting candidates for experimental validation. Correlation analysis of DepMap gene-dependency profiles revealed distinct vulnerability patterns associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, outlining a characteristic landscape of genetic dependencies.\nTogether, our integrative framework uniting constraint-based metabolic modeling and machine learning systematically reveals how non-canonical TCA cycle dynamics underpin metabolic plasticity and promote malignant traits."

We present a mathematical model for the vectorial capacity that incorporates multiple host types and their interactions, focusing specifically on West Nile virus transmission by <i>Culex pipiens</i> mosquitoes. Our model integrates climate-dependent parameters affecting vector biology with vector control interventions to predict transmission potential under various scenarios. We demonstrate how vector control interventions targeting one host type can significantly impact transmission dynamics across all host populations. By examining the effects of different vector control tool modes of action (repellency, preprandial killing, disarming and postprandial killing), we develop target product profiles that minimise unintended consequences of vector control. Notably, we identify the optimal intervention characteristics needed to prevent repellency on dead-end hosts from inadvertently increasing transmission among reservoir hosts. This research provides valuable insights for public health officials designing targeted vector control strategies and offers a flexible modelling framework that can be adapted to other vector-borne diseases with complex host dynamics."

CAMs often have multiple paralogs but the possible redundancy of such paralogs remains underexplored. Using circuit-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice deficient for Slitrk1 and Slitrk2, we show that these paralogs lack specific laminar expression in mature hippocampal neurons but divergently guide the specificity of neural circuits in distinct hippocampal subfields. Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 regulate distinct facets of excitatory synaptic properties in a microcircuit-dependent manner through binding to LAR-RPTPs, and additionally in the case of Slitrk2, through binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins and TrkB. Analyses of Slitrk2 V89M knock-in mice revealed that this schizophrenia-associated substitution acts uniquely as a loss-of-function mutation in some microcircuits to impair excitatory synaptic transmission, asynchronous release, and spatial reference memory. These findings demonstrate that even structurally and biochemically similar synaptic CAMs can play distinct roles in specifying neural circuit architecture."

Groisman</p>\n\nThe intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium confronts cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation inside macrophages. This stress alters carbon metabolism and subverts canonical carbon source preferences by reducing synthesis of 3\u2032, 5\u2032-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the essential allosteric activator of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), master regulator of carbon utilization. How, then, does <i>S.</i> Typhimurium preferentially utilize CRP-cAMP-dependent carbon sources inside macrophages? We now report that the virulence and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis regulator PhoP controls CRP-cAMP-dependent transcription, metabolism, and growth on a mixture of carbon sources during low cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We determine that the PhoP-activated MgtA and MgtB proteins promote CRP-cAMP activity by importing Mg<sup>2+</sup>, indispensable cofactor of the cAMP-synthesizing adenylate cyclase CyaA. Significantly, the PhoP-activated MgtC preserves cAMP amounts despite reducing abundance of CyaA substrate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) because ATP at high concentrations inhibits CyaA. Restoring CRP activity by supplementation of cAMP or introduction of the constitutively active <i>crp*</i> allele corrected CRP-dependent transcriptional and growth behaviors of the <i>mgtA mgtB</i> mutant. By controlling cAMP synthesis, PhoP dictates the amounts of active CRP, thereby reprogramming <i>S.</i> Typhimurium\u2019s metabolism."

    "content": "<p>by Sneh Harsh, Hsiao-Yun Liu, Pradeep K. Bhaskar, Christine Rushlow, Erika A. Bach</p>\n\nMaintenance of somatic sex identity is essential for adult tissue function. In the <i>Drosophila</i> testis, adult somatic stem cells known as cyst stem cells (CySCs) require the transcription factor Chinmo to preserve male identity. Loss of Chinmo leads to reprogramming of CySCs into their ovarian counterparts through induction of the female-specific RNA-binding protein Transformer<sup>F</sup> (Tra<sup>F</sup>), though the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we identify the pioneer transcription factor Zelda (Zld) as a critical mediator of this sex reversal. In wild-type CySCs, <i>zld</i> mRNA is repressed by microRNAs (miRs), but following Chinmo loss, these miRs are downregulated, allowing <i>zld</i> mRNA to be translated. Zld is necessary for feminization of <i>chinmo</i>-mutant CySCs, and ectopic expression of Zld in wild-type CySCs is sufficient to induce Tra<sup>F</sup> and drive female reprogramming. Two Zld target genes, <i>qkr58E-2</i> and <i>Ecdysone receptor</i> (<i>EcR</i>), are upregulated in <i>chinmo</i>-mutant CySCs and are normally female-biased in adult gonads. Qkr58E-2 facilitates Tra<sup>F</sup> production, while EcR promotes female gene expression programs. Zld overexpression feminizes otherwise wild-type CySCs by upregulating EcR, which in turn downregulates the <i>chinmo</i> gene. Strikingly, overexpression of Zld also feminizes adult male adipose tissue by inducing Tra<sup>F</sup> and downregulating Chinmo, indicating that Zld can override male identity in multiple adult XY tissues. Together, these findings uncover a post-transcriptional mechanism in which miRs-mediated repression of a pioneer factor safeguards male identity and prevents inappropriate activation of the female program in adult somatic cells."

Gribble, Frank Reimann, Rodger A. Liddle, John F. Rawls</p>\n\nEnteroendocrine cells (EECs) are rare sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that coordinate digestive physiology by secreting a diverse repertoire of peptide hormones. These hormones are the main effectors of EEC function, and their characterization requires direct observation by mass spectrometry due to the specialized protein cleavage and posttranslational modifications that yield their mature forms. Based on the distinct subset of hormones they predominantly secrete, EECs can be categorized into subtypes. How each EEC subtype is specified, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we describe EEC subtype differentiation and hormone production in the zebrafish. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified EEC progenitors and six EEC subtypes in zebrafish and revealed that their expression profiles are consistent across larval and adult stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of isolated zebrafish EECs identified highly processed peptides derived from 19 of 23 hormone-coding genes expressed by EECs, including a previously undescribed zebrafish <i>secretin</i> ortholog. We assembled reporters for zebrafish EEC subtypes to test the lineage relationships between EEC subtypes and the EEC progenitor population, which expresses <i>neurogenin 3 (neurog3)</i>. Despite its essential role in mammalian EEC differentiation, we found that selective cytotoxic ablation of <i>neurog3</i>+ cells in zebrafish only reduced a subset of EEC subtypes and loss of the <i>neurog3</i> gene had no impact on EEC numbers. Finally, we discovered that selective ablation of <i>ghrelin</i>+ EECs reduced a different subset of EEC subtypes, together suggesting that <i>neurog3</i>+ and <i>ghrelin</i>+ cells serve as distinct precursors for separate EEC subtypes. We anticipate these observations and resources will facilitate future studies in the zebrafish to discern the developmental biology, physiology, and endocrinology of EEC subtypes."

Dislocations with an [010] Burgers vector component (b dislocations) have been recorded rarely. Here we show an experimentally deformed olivine sample has a substantial population (17%) of b dislocations. Electron Backscatter Diffraction maps of crystal orientations provided information on dislocations from the orientation gradients. Maps show the b dislocations form subgrain walls like those formed by other dislocation types and are interpreted to form similarly by glide and climb, so b dislocations are mobile. To confirm our approach, we used Electron Backscatter Diffraction maps to select an area for Transmission Electron Microscopy imaging, down to an atomic scale image of a b dislocation. Our sample was deformed within range of subduction zone conditions; our approach can be used to investigate the scale and conditions of b slip in the mantle more widely."

Observations reveal that strong Central Pacific (CP) La Ni\u00f1as and extreme Eastern Pacific (EP) El Ni\u00f1os occur more frequently than their counterparts, a feature standard LIMs fail to capture. We introduce a modified model, the Non\u2010Gaussian LIM (NG\u2010LIM), which transforms the LIM variables to better simulate ENSO asymmetry and diversity. Specifically, the NG\u2010LIM reproduces the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) skewness and the inverted U\u2010shaped relationship between the first two principal components of Tropical Pacific SST anomalies, reflecting more frequent strong CP La Ni\u00f1as and extreme EP El Ni\u00f1os.

This study investigates hydrogen generation during a flow\u2010through experiment on fractured iron\u2010rich cores packed with proppants, simulating a stimulated subsurface environment. Hydrogen generation initially declined over time. Introducing a thermochemical fluid to accelerate the reaction via thermal enhancement did not yield measurable hydrogen gains. Subsequent acid treatment for 2\u00a0hr led to a 30\u2010fold increase in hydrogen generation, which was sustained for 144\u00a0hr before the onset of a decline. Post\u2010acidizing hydrogen generation remained larger than pre\u2010acidizing hydrogen. Post\u2010experiment characterizations confirmed the development of preferential flow paths, mineral precipitation along fracture surfaces, and fluid\u2010induced surface alteration.

Humps in heating curves below the Curie temperature of magnetite are observed frequently. We present \u03ba\u2010T curves with hump features in magnetite\u2010bearing flood basalt samples. Heating\u2010cooling experiments combined with theoretical principles suggest that these humps reflect primarily the transition from the stable single domain (SSD) to the superparamagnetic (SP) state, with possible contributions from maghemite decomposition and stress release. Scanning electron microscopy confirms magnetite intergrowths with <100\u00a0nm size, which supports the presence of SSD\u2010SP domain states and the diversity of hump shapes. Changes in magnetic interactions, internal stress distribution, and internal subdivision due to maghemitization likely contribute to different hump shapes in heating and cooling curves. The findings indicate that humps provide a diagnostic feature associated with thermal relaxation in fine magnetite in diverse lithologies and suggest caution in interpreting \u03ba\u2010T decreases at intermediate temperatures solely by maghemite decomposition."

Such distribution of Maxwellian electrons appears in 1.3\u20135\u00a0keV and is modulated by firehose fluctuations: electron fluxes are high at wave troughs (|B|\u2010minima) and are low at wave crests. The results of Liouville mapping and the electron loss cone angles are consistent with the spacecraft observations respectively, indicating such distribution is formed by the combination of global\u2010scale Fermi acceleration and local\u2010scale electron trapping.

We use a 3\u2010D Exospheric Global Model (EGM) including subsurface diffusion to study the evolution of sulfur and sodium in Mercury's subsurface. We identify similar spatial distributions of the sulfur reservoir and of the hollows, but no relationship in the case of sodium.

Using observations and reanalysis data, we observe an intensified interannual variability of the Kara Sea SIG during boreal late winter (December\u2013March) since 2004/2005. This arises from the retreat of active ice production zones in response to the strengthened modulation of the westward\u2010shifted North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Using a sea ice concentration budget, we quantitatively partition the NAO's contribution to total SIG variability post\u20102004 (\u223c63.3%), revealing comparably dominant roles of thermodynamic and dynamic processes. During this period, the negative NAO\u2010associated surface winds concurrently cool sea surface and export sea ice from the Kara Sea, thereby injecting freshwater into the lower latitudes.

    "content": "Abstract\nCratons are generally thought to be characterized by stable, long\u2010lived mantle roots. However, recent studies have suggested that the lithospheric mantle may be prone to removal, implying that it may be denser than the asthenosphere. To address these suggestions, we use a global data set of mantle xenoliths to estimate the density structure of the cratonic lithospheric mantle (CLM), which we then compare with the density of the asthenospheric mantle at equivalent depths. Most of the CLM is either neutrally buoyant or slightly positively buoyant relative to the asthenosphere. The exception is where pyroxenite has accumulated due to melt infiltration. For these pyroxenites to remain within the CLM over geologically significant timescales they must be relatively small, that is, \u22641\u201320\u00a0km in size for a CLM viscosity of 1021\u20131023\u00a0Pa\u00b7s.

Energy conservation enforces a negative correlation between the climate feedback and historical forcing for a given change in global\u2010mean temperature. Here, we examine the negative correlation between the radiative forcing due to aerosol\u2010cloud interactions and the shortwave cloud feedback to warming that appears in a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE). The PPE is not tuned to match the historical record, yet a negative correlation emerges over the extratropics due to the combined effects of liquid cloud precipitation efficiency and radiative saturation in the shortwave. Using an energy balance model, we argue that these processes combine to push Earth System Models to yield a temperature record in keeping with observations, but also limit our ability to constrain future warming posterior with the temperature record."

Multiple reanalyses indicate that regional quasi\u2010biweekly rainfall variability increased by 12%\u201344% in the recent two decades relative to the earlier two. This intensification is driven mainly by dynamical changes in vertical velocity perturbations, while thermodynamic increases in mean moisture play a secondary role. The strong dynamical influence also accounts for much of the spread in historical simulations from CMIP6 and CESM2\u2010LENS. Only when thermodynamic moistening outweighs this dynamical uncertainty do models consistently project stronger quasi\u2010biweekly variability under future scenarios. These findings highlight the central role of quasi\u2010biweekly circulation in monsoonal rainfall extremes and the need to improve its representation in climate models."

    "content": "Abstract\nFrom 10 to 12 May 2024, a series of coronal mass ejections led to one of the strongest geomagnetic storms of the century, referred to as the Mother's Day or Gannon Storm. MMS's position on the dayside magnetosphere on 11 May provided observations of a strongly driven and compressed \u223c7RE $\\left(\\sim 7\\ {R}_{E}\\right)$ reconnecting magnetopause. Because of the driving conditions, the magnetopause became saturated with O+ ${O}^{+}$ outflows that dominated the mass density of the plasma environment. In the reconnecting magnetopause, MMS observes signatures of parallel electron heating on the magnetopause's magnetosheath side, but anomalous and significant electron cooling, especially from the perpendicular electron temperature on the magnetosphere side, possibly driven by additional mechanisms besides reconnection. Even with the strong driving and O+ ${O}^{+}$ outflows, we find an expected (0.19\u00b10.04) $(0.19\\pm 0.04)$ normalized reconnection rate for the primary exhaust, indicating insensitivity to these conditions. The unnormalized rate, however, is atypically large and scales with the driving conditions."

We present 5 events from these orbits where MESSENGER encountered Earth\u2010like dipolarization regions characterized by enhanced field strengths up to 20\u00a0nT above the intrinsic planetary field, and an average \u224323% $\\simeq 23\\%$ decrease and \u224344% $\\simeq 44\\%$ increase in plasma proton density and temperature, respectively, for 1\u20132\u00a0min periods, comparable to Hermean substorm timescales.

Supported by estimates of decreased flux tube entropy during these events, we suggest these dipolarization regions are formed by the pileup of dipolarization fronts and formation of a substorm current wedge."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study examines the genesis of atmospheric bores near sunset and their role in initiating and maintaining late\u2010afternoon mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) over the Southern North China Plain. A key finding is that 20% of documented bore occur during the sunset period. These bores form in the local environment preconditioned by the convective outflows from late afternoon MCSs, or by sea breezes that peak at this time. These bores aid in initiating and maintaining afternoon convection, subsequently favoring the development of nocturnal MCSs and associated bores. While bore research often concentrates on their impact on nocturnal MCSs, this study highlights that accurately predicting the diurnal cycle of MCSs requires properly representing bores. Thus, it helps address the long\u2010standing challenge of simulating the diurnal cycle of convective rainfall in weather and climate models."

Although the Florida Current at 27\u00b0N has been continuously monitored for over 40\u00a0years, spatial variability in transport along the broader Florida Shelf remains less explored. Three\u00a0decades (1993\u20132023)\u00a0of satellite altimetry allow assessment of\u00a0surface transport trends across four primary transects from the Yucat\u00e1n Channel to 30\u00b0N, and along 32 supplementary sections tracking the Gulf Stream path. Bayesian regression reveals negative trends upstream, while quasi\u2010stable behavior downstream (off North Florida). Wavelet analysis identifies dominant seasonal to decadal variability, with the strongest coherence within the straits. Model (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model) output confirms spatially heterogeneous trends and downstream stabilization of volume transport. These findings suggest that trends of the Gulf Stream are spatially non\u2010uniform, involving apparent transport reductions balanced by downstream compensation. Thus, it is necessary to resolve along\u2010stream variability when assessing long\u2010term changes in western boundary current systems."

However, observing the two\u2010dimensional water surface elevation (WSE) fields that govern these interactions remains a long\u2010standing challenge, limiting understanding of hydraulic regime shifts. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission provides unprecedented capability to resolve these dynamics with high\u2010resolution, spatially continuous WSE data. Taking the Poyang Lake\u2010Yangtze River system as a case study, we reveal a divergent seasonal response in water surface slope. The river mainstream slope steepens during the dry season (2.61\u00a0cm/km), while the river\u2010lake confluence paradoxically exhibits steeper or reversed slopes during wet season. This mechanism leads to a seasonal backwater effect, more extensive in the dry season (17.2\u00a0km) than wet season (14.8\u00a0km). Our findings offer a globally applicable framework for understanding river\u2010lake hydrodynamics, showcasing SWOT's potential for advancing hydrodynamic modeling and water management."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study examines extreme heatwaves in the Caribbean from 1971 to 2025, focusing on their climatology and large\u2010scale drivers. We find statistically significant increase in heatwave events, with major urban centers experiencing up to three additional heatwave days and 1\u00b0F (\u223c0.6\u00b0C) rise in temperatures per decade. Extreme heatwaves, where both daily maximum and minimum heat indices exceed the 95th percentile, are now more frequent, prolonged, and intense, with events reaching maximum \u201cfeel\u2010like\u201d temperatures above 115\u00b0F (\u223c46\u00b0C). These increases may be attributed to global warming, as reflected in sea surface temperatures. Strong El Ni\u00f1o phases raise heatwave temperatures by about 4.6\u00b0F (\u223c2.5\u00b0C) and increase events by about 2.15 per heat season, across the Caribbean. Diabatic heating drives 70%\u201380% of heatwave temperature anomalies, with adiabatic warming contributing \u223c30%, and small contributions from advection. These findings enhance understanding of Caribbean heatwaves, offering insights for managing future related risks."

    "content": "Biofilm-based microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising technology that converts CO2 into industrially relevant organic compounds using renewable energy sources. The highest performing MES systems reported to date consist of biofilm-driven microbial communities. However, for a successful deployment of this technology, we still need to overcome key challenges, including the long colonization time of the biocathode and the difficulty of controlling the product profile. To address these challenges, it is crucial to better understand the key microbial components responsible for the desired metabolic products, and how they assemble and function as a community. In this study, we conducted an in-depth characterisation of three high-performing mixed MES communities using metagenomics, metaproteomics and advanced analysis of metagenome-derived metabolic networks. Our findings identified Eubacterium limosum, Sporomusa sphaeroides and Clostridium aromativorans as key contributors to the production of acetate, butyrate and caproate via the Wood-Ljungdahl and the reverse {beta}-oxidation pathways. A higher production of butyrate and caproate was observed in reactors with higher abundance of C. aromativorans, an organism only recently discovered and never reported in gas-fermenting systems before. The recovered genome of C. aromativorans, reconstructed in a single circular fragment, provides a more comprehensive genomic representation than the current reference. In addition, we found genes related to lactate and ethanol production from acetyl-CoA in the metagenomes, including proteomic evidence for lactate production. This study provides key insights into the microbial players, metabolic processes and microbial community features driving product formation in biofilm-based MES, bringing this technology closer to industrial application."

    "content": "Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the major risk factor for gastric cancer worldwide; yet the exact mechanisms behind this link remain unclear. H. pylori-associated tissue changes often disrupt the gastric microbiome, enabling secondary gastric colonization by oral bacteria. Among these secondary colonizers, Fusobacterium species have documented associations with several gastrointestinal cancers. We found that both F. animalis and F. nucleatum invade cultured human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, but F. animalis exhibited higher adherence and invasion, and hypoxic conditions promoted higher bacterial survival. Both adherence and invasion were inhibited by exogenous GalNAc, a glycan commonly observed in membrane glycoproteins of adenocarcinoma cells, and a target of the fusobacterial adhesin Fap2. Using a mouse model of gastric metaplasia, we found that F. animalis colonized gastric tissue only after metaplasia onset, growing in multispecies biofilms in the mucus layer, while F. nucleatum colonized neither healthy nor metaplastic gastric tissue. Metaplasia led to upregulation of Gal-GalNAc in the stomach, and reduced gastric acidity allowed higher F. animalis loads in this model. By contrast, inflammation and the presence of H. pylori did not significantly influence stomach colonization by F. animalis. Overall, our data support a model in which H. pylori-induced metaplasia makes the stomach susceptible to secondary infection by another cancer-associated microbe, F. animalis."

This species is known to produce a variety of health beneficial metabolites, including aromatic lactic acids (ALAs), supporting early life immune development. However, the regulation of ALA production in B. infantis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how environmental factors, such as substrate availability and pH affect B. infantis DSM20088 growth and ALA production in vitro. Bacterial batch cultivations supplemented with different amino acid concentrations revealed a linear relationship between indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (OH-PLA), and phenyllactic acid (PLA) production and exogenous concentrations of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, respectively. Furthermore, chemostat cultivations at physiological relevant pH levels (4.5, 5.5 and 6.5) showed that an acidic pH slowed growth and shifted ALA production by B. infantis. Overall, ALA concentrations correlated strongly with bacterial abundance across and within pH levels, showing that cell density is a major determinant of ALA production. After considering the growth limiting effects of lower environmental pH, it had limited impact on the total production of ALAs, but the relative production of PLA was stepwise enhanced at more acidic pH at the expense of ILA, independent of cell density. In conclusion, this study shows that cell density, substrate availability and environmental pH determine aromatic lactic acid production by B. infantis."

    "content": "RNA modifications play essential roles in cellular physiology by modulating RNA structure, stability, and translation efficiency. Among these, dihydrouridine is a conserved tRNA modification synthesized by the flavin-dependent enzymes DusA, DusB, and DusC, which introduces flexibility at defined uridine positions in the D-loop. While structural and biochemical studies in Escherichia coli have clarified Dus enzymes substrate specificities, their functional relevance in other bacterial pathogens remains uncharacterized. Here, we present the first functional characterization of the contribution of Dus enzymes to an important urinary tract pathogen, Proteus mirabilis. Insertional mutants were generated in dusA, dusB, and dusC in P. mirabilis strain HI4320 for evaluation of virulence-relevant phenotypes. All mutants grew similarly to wild-type under multiple culture conditions, although loss of dusB caused a fitness defect during growth in human urine. Disruption of dusB also resulted in increased biofilm biomass, impaired swimming motility, enhanced outer membrane permeability, and increased susceptibility to detergents and certain antibiotics, while disruption of dusA or dusC only impacted biofilm formation and susceptibility to detergents. In a murine model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, dusB was also critical for fitness in all organs during co-challenge against wild-type as well as overall colonization and ascending infection during independent challenge. In contrast, dusC did not contribute to fitness and dusA showed a modest, compartment-specific contribution to fitness, as the dusA::Kan mutant was outcompeted in the bladder. Together, these findings identify DusB as a key regulator of motility, membrane integrity, and host fitness in P. mirabilis, linking tRNA modification to virulence."

    "content": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) colonization of the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for transmission and invasive disease. To investigate how repeated asymptomatic colonization shapes immunity and influences bacterial traits, we developed the Repeated Asymptomatic Murine Pneumococcal Colonization (RAMPC3) model using strains belonging to serotypes: 2 (D39), 3 (WU2), and 4 (TIGR4). Sequential colonization revealed strain- and exposure-order-dependent effects on bacterial burden, with initial colonization yielding robust carriage and subsequent exposures resulting in diminished burden and rapid clearance. Humoral profiling demonstrated antigenic imprinting: the first colonizing strain largely determined IgG and IgA specificity, with minimal diversification after repeated exposures. Reactivity was strongest for biofilm-associated antigens correlating with each strains biofilm-forming capacity. Using TIGR4 mutants deficient in biofilm formation, we confirmed that in vivo aggregate formation drives humoral responses. Human sera from naturally colonized adults mirrored these findings, favoring biofilm antigens independent from capsule. Protection was demonstrated as triple-colonized mice exhibited reduced mortality and bacteremia following pneumococcal pneumonia challenge. Moreover, the initial colonizing strain influenced protection against heterologous infection, underscoring the lasting imprint of the biofilm phenotype on immunity. Finally, IgA responses in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue paralleled serum IgA patterns, validating systemic measurements as a proxy for mucosal immunity. Collectively, these results reveal that biofilm formation during colonization is a key determinant of humoral immunity and protection, providing insight into pneumococcal biology and informing strategies to design next-generation interventions."

    "content": "In crop rotation systems, plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects can modulate nutrient cycling in soil, like organic nitrogen cycling. Organic nitrogen (N) is present in plant and microbial necromass, and it must be depolymerized by microbes to become available for crops. Since plant identity can modulate the microbial communities' diversity and composition, we thought that previous crop identity would also change the microbial depolymerization capacity, and thereby impact soil N availability, and the quality and yield of the following crop. To test this, two legumes (Vicia faba L., i.e. faba bean, and Pisum sativum L., i.e., yellow pea) were grown in two fields in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada. During the following growing season, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was sown and received, or not poultry manure as an organic fertilizer. We determined the diversity and composition of the microbial communities and their enzymatic depolymerization capacity in the soil and the rhizosphere each growing season. During wheat growth, previous legumes shaped bacterial (p-value = 0.006) and fungal (p-value = 0.001) communities and modulated the enzymatic activity of wheat-associated rhizosphere microbes. Faba bean increased {beta}-glucosidase activities by up to 13% (1.13-fold) in the wheat rhizosphere compared to peas. Faba bean as a previous crop also increased wheat grain protein content at harvest by up to 0.17% as compared to peas. Altogether, our results show that faba beans, through lasting shifts in the microbial communities, can enhance microbial depolymerization activities in the wheat rhizosphere, impacting its N nutrition. Understanding plant-soil feedback in crop rotation systems is crucial to improve our practices and sustainably meet crops' nutritional needs."

    "content": "Septins are conserved cytoskeletal GTPases that regulate morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and cell-surface organization in fungi. In most model and pathogenic yeasts, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, core septin subunits such as Cdc3 and Cdc12 are essential and their loss results in lethal cytokinetic defects. In Cryptococcus neoformans, by contrast, deletion of CDC12 yields viable cells that grow normally under permissive conditions, raising the question of how this pathogen maintains cell integrity without a functional septin complex. To address this, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type cells and a cdc12{Delta} mutant. The cdc12{Delta} strain showed a focused set of transcriptional changes, with induction of genes involved in cell wall remodeling, stress-dependent morphogenetic programs, and pathways that promote fitness under compromised cytoskeletal conditions. Genetic analysis of the most highly induced genes uncovered factors that contribute to proliferation in the absence of Cdc12, including a previously uncharacterized aspartic-type endopeptidase that becomes essential when septin function is lost. These findings outline the compensatory circuitry that permits septin-independent growth in C. neoformans and help explain why this pathogen can tolerate septin loss. This intrinsic plasticity highlights C. neoformans as a powerful comparative model for studying the evolution and function of the septin complex."

    "content": "Prophages, phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes, are widespread, yet, the extent to which these resident parasites contribute to host fitness and shape evolutionary trajectories, particularly in polymicrobial environments, remains unclear. Here, we use an experimental evolution approach in which a polylysogenic bacterial strain carrying phages on both its chromosome and plasmids evolves under environmental conditions that modulate the costs and benefits of prophage carriage. By tracking bacterial growth and phage production over time, we uncover divergent, environment-dependent adaptive strategies among lysogens. Some populations evolve dramatically increased phage production, with titers rising over 1,000-fold, whereas in environments where phages impose strong fitness costs, prophages are either purged or domesticated. Across all evolved populations, adaptation is accompanied by defects in cellular segmentation arising from mutations in the divisome and Tat translocation pathways. Whole-genome sequencing revealed shifts in lysate composition, suggesting altered interactions among co-occurring prophages, alongside the loss of plasmid-encoded prophage antibiotic resistance genes and reduced resistance to two distinct antibiotic classes. Together, our results demonstrate that prophages are dynamic evolutionary players whose interactions with host genomes and ecological context jointly shape bacterial adaptation, in complex communities, with implications for exploiting phage-antibiotic trade-offs in therapeutic design."

    "content": "Bacteria survive and reproduce in fluctuating environments by balancing their basic physiological needs, such as relying on iron-containing enzymes to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) while conserving scarce iron. Understanding the regulatory networks that balance these conflicting needs is key to deciphering bacterial adaptability. Here, we identify a coherent feed-forward loop in mycobacteria that integrates the transcriptional regulator FurA3, the small RNA MrsI, RNA sponge FutR, and the catalase-peroxidase KatG. This circuit fine-tunes antioxidant responses according to iron availability. Under iron limitation, the iron-containing enzyme KatG is dually repressed by FurA3 transcriptionally and by MrsI post-transcriptionally, which conserves iron at the cost of antioxidant capacity. However, when iron deprivation coincides with oxidative stress, the circuit triggers an emergency response: H2O2 inactivates FurA3, relieving transcriptional repression of katG and futR, while induced FutR sequesters MrsI to post-transcriptionally derepress katG expression, enabling rapid KatG synthesis for effective peroxide detoxification. Our findings reveal a tightly regulated network that allows mycobacteria to balance iron homeostasis and oxidative stress defense, providing mechanistic insights into bacterial physiological trade-offs."

    "content": "Bacteriophages represent a vast reservoir of genetic diversity however, functional annotation remains a major challenge, as most predicted gene products lack detectable similarity to characterized gene families. Experimental approaches such as systematic overexpression screens provide an avenue for identifying phage genes that influence bacterial physiology. Here, we report an overexpression screen of all 123 predicted protein-coding genes from Cluster L1 mycobacteriophage LeBron, the first representative of this cluster to undergo genome-wide functional analysis. Expression assays in Mycobacterium smegmatis revealed that 39 genes (32%) impaired host growth, with nineteen of these toxic genes (49%) assigned no known function. The proportion of cytotoxic genes observed in LeBron is comparable to findings from Clusters K and F, despite minimal sequence conservation across clusters. Interestingly, a subset of LeBron's toxic genes appear to be functionally analogous to previously identified toxic genes in other clusters, suggesting conserved biological activities carried out by non-homologous proteins. Additionally, this analysis uncovered several novel gene families that elicit strong cytotoxic effects, expanding the known catalog of phage-derived bacterial growth inhibitors. These results provide new insights into phage gene functions and demonstrate the value of genome-wide expression screening for uncovering conserved and cluster-specific interactions between bacteriophages and their hosts."

Soil acts as a natural reservoir for many critical bacterial pathogens, however, the lack of accurate, high-throughput methods to identify the distribution of bacterial pathogens in soil and other environments greatly limits our ability to develop effective surveillance and disease management strategies and policies. Here, we present MetaPatho, an easy-to-use, rapid, robust, and shotgun metagenomics-based tool for identifying human and plant bacterial pathogens in environmental metagenomes. We first constructed high-quality pathogenic databases for the identification of human and plant bacterial pathogens. In-silico tests and soil spike-in experiments, including pathogen DNA spike-in and cell spike-in tests, were then employed to examine the accuracy and robustness of our tool. The in-silico tests suggested that the tool accurately identified pathogenic sequences, achieving an average accuracy of 97.4%, with a specificity of 98.1% and a sensitivity of 97.2%. Further analyses from soil spike-in experiments showed that the tool accurately detected bacterial pathogens at different concentrations, achieving an average accuracy of 96.3%. Overall, our tools can provide a high-throughput and accurate surveillance of bacterial pathogens in environmental metagenomes, contributing to an effective risk management associated with human and plant diseases."

    "content": "Bacterial persisters are phenotypically antibiotic-tolerant variants driving recurrent infections. While motility is a key trait for bacterial survival and virulence, its function throughout the persister lifecycle remains poorly understood. Here, we unveil a stage-specific trajectory for motility that underlies sophisticated survival strategies in rifampin-induced Escherichia coli persistence. During persister formation, intact motility functions as an immediate behavioral defense that decreases intracellular bactericidal antibiotic concentrations to ensure survival. This initial behavioral defense provides critical time for transcriptional reprogramming in persisters, which, by downregulating the major outer membrane porins (OmpC & OmpF) that facilitate antibiotic influx, supplants the preceding motility-based strategy. Subsequently, in structurally fortified persisters, motility becomes dispensable and gradually diminishes - a process independent of cell bioenergetic profile - yet re-emerges as essential for timely resuscitation upon antibiotic removal. Collectively, these findings establish the significance of motility in bacterial survival, redefine persister defense against antibiotics as a transition from behavioral to architectural strategies, and identify motility as a potential adjuvant therapeutic target."

    "content": "Influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) continually threaten global health, with IAV posing a risk of emerging pandemics. Rapid viral evolution makes current treatments less effective, highlighting the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals. Targeting host factors essential for viral replication may offer a highly promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy. In this context, cereblon (CRBN), a substrate adaptor of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is found to promote both IAV and IBV replication as a key pro-viral host factor. Mechanistically, CRBN targets and degrades AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via the proteasome. This CRBN-driven degradation shifts the metabolism of the infected cells toward anabolism, promoting lipid droplet (LD) formation and creating a microenvironment favorable for viral replication. Genetic depletion or inhibition of CRBN stabilizes AMPK, significantly reduces LD formation, and effectively suppresses the replication of various IAV and IBV strains in vivo, demonstrating its broad-spectrum potential. Notably, Crbn knockout mice show marked resistance to lethal IAV infection. CRBN inhibition with immunomodulatory imide drugs--known CRBN inhibitors--significantly decreases IAV replication in vivo. This research underscores CRBN as a crucial regulator of host metabolism during viral infection, revealing the CRBN-AMPK axis as a promising target for host-directed pan-influenza antiviral development."

    "content": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacterium that causes debilitating TB-like pulmonary infections for which effective treatment options are lacking. Poor in vivo drug efficacy may stem from altered vulnerability of drug targets driven by host-specific environmental conditions. To enable validation and prioritization of candidate drug targets in vivo, we exploited CRISPRi (CRi) gene silencing in multiple mouse infection models. Inducible silencing of ftsZMab, a previously validated target, and three predicted targets (leuSMab, folPMab, fusAMab) confirmed their essentiality in vitro. We then assessed the in vivo vulnerability of these targets in both immunocompetent C57BL/6N and immunodeficient NSG mice by assessing the impact of CRi silencing on pulmonary mycobacterial burden. In NSG mice, silencing of all four genes led to comparable decreases in Mab burden. However, in C57BL/6N mice, the degree of Mab clearance varied among targets, suggesting that immune pressure may influence the outcome of CRi-mediated gene silencing. Notably, repression of fusAMab yielded a larger decline in mycobacterial burden in C57BL/6N mice despite a lower level of gene silencing in vitro, consistent with enhanced vulnerability of this target. Overall, this study demonstrated that ftsZMab, leuSMab, folPMab, and fusAMab are essential for Mab growth in vitro and, for the first time, validated their vulnerability to inhibition by CRi during infection. These data also identified potential context-dependent target vulnerabilities, which could inform the prioritization of bacterial drug targets and accelerate the development of effective therapeutics for Mab infections."

The disease burden and financial cost associated with C. jejuni pose significant challenges to the global public health system. A stable, scalable and standardised typing scheme is essential for epidemiological and AMR surveillance for prevention and control of C. jejuni infections. We curated and assembled a C. jejuni global whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset of 63,012 publicly available Illumina short-read genomes. A C. jejuni global cgMLST scheme with 1161 core loci was developed using a representative subset of 2,587 genomes. HierCC clustering of the cgMLST profiles was performed for all levels and suitable HierCC levels were selected to enable epidemiological analysis. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prediction was performed using AbritAMR. A HierCC cluster was classified as a resistant cluster if [&ge;]80% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic.We selected 9 HierCC levels (HC2, HC4, HC6, HC12, HC19, HC55, HC100, HC167 and HC264) to form the multilevel HierCC scheme. The multilevel design allowed natural and genetically discrete clusters to be described consistently at both global and local scale. We showcased the utility of the scheme with identification of country and continent specific clusters at HC264 to HC19 levels and differentiation of animal host specific (specialist) from human infection (generalist) clusters at HC264 to HC55 levels. In the USA dataset from 2016 to 2022, a total of 276 resistant clusters were identified with 22 resistant clusters increasing in frequence in recent years. An increased prevalence of C. jejuni carrying 50S_L22 mutations in the USA was observed from 2016 to 2022, suggesting continuing selection pressure from macrolide use in the farm animals. We developed a novel multilevel HierCC typing scheme to standardise AMR surveillance and provide flexible typing resolution for both short- and long-term epidemiological investigations of C. jejuni at global and local levels."

    "content": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is distributed worldwide among domestic cats and non-domestic felids. Frequent spillover events from domestic cats to wild felids have resulted in fatal disease in individual animals and outbreaks in free-ranging populations. Domestic cats carry both endogenous FeLV (enFeLV; proviral copies of the virus in the cat genome) and exogenous variants of FeLV (exFeLV). These can recombine, producing variants with recombinant envelope genes and altered receptor usage, while non-domestic felid species, except for wildcats (Felis silvestris), do not have endogenous FeLV. This study applied amplification of the FeLV envelope gene combined with Illumina sequencing of PCR products to determine the envelope gene diversity and transmission dynamics of FeLV variants in a non-domestic species, guigna (Leopardus guigna), a small felid native to Chile and Argentina. Seven PCR amplicons from five free ranging guignas were sequenced. The Illumina contigs confirmed that the origin of infection was from Chilean domestic cats. However, a distinct guigna cluster was identified, characterised by unique variations that differentiate it from domestic cat sequences and may indicate that transmission is also occurring between guigna independent of domestic cats. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that all guigna sequences group within a Chile-specific FeLV clade, closely related to Chilean domestic cats but clearly distinct from international FeLV-A strains. We detected 96 intra-host variants across 43 genomic sites, 64 of which were non-synonymous, including one that resulted in a premature stop codon. Some of these have previously been reported in both domestic and non-domestic species from other regions. Additionally, intrahost variation analysis revealed greater genetic diversity and a higher number of non-synonymous mutations across the env gene in guigna. Unlike the variation patterns typically observed in domestic cats, where mutations in the env gene are predominantly located in the SU region, particularly within the receptor binding domain (RBD), here, a substantial proportion of mutations in guignas were found in the TM region. The pattern of mutations, with predominance of G to A transition (62.6%), strongly suggests an influence of the APOBEC-mediated hypermutation, antiviral immune system, on guigna isolates. Although FeLV-B primers produced amplicons, no genuine FeLV-B sequences were detected, consistent with amplification of FeLV-A templates due to primer cross-reactivity. The absence of large deletions or recombination signatures also indicates that only FeLV-A like strains are currently circulating in guignas. Our findings provide evidence of intra-species transmission within guigna populations, demonstrated using Illumina sequencing, a method not commonly applied in this context. Thus, this study offers a novel perspective on the disease dynamics of transmission between domestic and non-domestic felids."

In vitro transcriptome profiling revealed that the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 two-component regulator CvsR mirrors some of the broader regulatory patterns observed under the exposure to PTI in planta. Our analyses indicated that during infection in planta, CvsR primarily governs a small core regulon centered on carbonic anhydrase and its associated transporter. Comparative RNA-seq analyses between the {Delta}cvsR and wild type strain further confirm this narrow regulatory scope. Moreover, the majority of bacterial transcriptional shifts appear to reflect indirect consequences of response to the host immune environment rather than direct CvsR-dependent regulation, including responses associated with sulfate starvation. Together, these findings suggest that PTI-driven bacterial transcriptional reprogramming is shaped predominantly by host immune status, with CvsR exerting modest, targeted control restricted to a limited set of genes."

Previous work on these communities has focused either on genomic characterization or metabolic activity measurements. However, to understand microbial ecophysiology in the deep biosphere taxonomic identity and metabolic function must be connected on both single-cell and ecosystem scales. In this work, we optimized a bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BONCAT-FACS) workflow for low-biomass deep-biosphere sediments obtained during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 385 (IODP 385). BONCAT-FACS with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing as well as metagenomics of sediment communities was applied to characterize translationally active communities in hydrothermally altered subsurface sediments of the Guaymas Basin. Our results revealed a heterotrophic microbial population throughout all sediments examined, with taxa translationally active down to our deepest sampling point, 154 meters below the seafloor. Based on 16S rRNA gene identities, the translationally active microbial community was dominated by heterotrophic members of the Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Deinococci, and Alphaproteobacteria. These taxa are likely key contributors to cycling the large quantities of hydrothermally altered organic matter in Guaymas Basin sediments. To further elucidate the metabolic capacity of active taxa, we mapped 16S rRNA gene amplicons to metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) previously obtained from IODP 385. These MAGs contained genes associated with C1 metabolism, carbohydrate degradation, and fermentation, indicating that active taxa leverage these metabolisms for energy conservation. Our results demonstrate that BONCAT-FACS provides high-throughput and single-cell insights into the metabolic activity of microbes in the low-biomass marine subsurface."

To tackle this challenge, we developed a panel of airway organoids from ten taxonomically diverse wildlife and livestock species and evaluated their susceptibility to influenza viruses of mammalian (pH1N1) and avian (H5N1) origin. Our analyses revealed large species-specific differences in infection rate and cytopathogenicity that aligned with known in vivo data and field observations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this organoid panel can serve as a powerful tool to elucidate receptor-binding mechanisms, viral dynamics, and early host adaptation in poorly characterized animal species. In summary, this work provides a robust and ethically viable approach for evaluating viral tropism and adaptation in wildlife species, and fills a critical gap in current pandemic preparedness, zoonotic disease surveillance, and wildlife conservation efforts."

Differences could arise from variation in sensitivity to temperature3 or constraints on the ability to respond to temperature. Without knowing whether populations differ in sensitivity--or in their ability to act on that sensitivity--we cannot identify which are most at risk. Using 1,555 population-years from 123 populations of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we show that populations have similar sensitivity to local temperature, advancing breeding by about one day per degree of warming. However, northern populations face tighter time constraints and greater exposure to recent warming. Northern populations have advanced laying dates the most, but still experience stronger selection for earlier breeding, especially in warm years; they have also declined most in breeding abundance. These findings show that vulnerability to climate change can arise not just from different sensitivity to warming, but from when and where populations can respond effectively. By disentangling sensitivity from timing constraints, our results support a general mechanism by which even uniformly responsive species can show uneven impacts of climate change across their ranges."

    "content": "ABSTRACT 1. The rule that most species are relatively rare and few are common has been of central importance to many branches of ecology. This rule also implies that just a few species make up the majority of plant biomass in ecosystems. Focussing plant trait research on the most common species in a region could be useful for many applications, including understanding macroscale patterns of species assemblages at the continental scale, identifying strategies of abundant species or estimating landscape-scale fluxes of carbon and water. 2. Here, we rank species based on their total cover across an entire continental region - Eastern and Central Australia - and report the extent of trait coverage in terms of vegetation cover. To calculate species abundance and trait coverage, we used ~100,000 vegetation plots from the Harmonised Australian Vegetation plot database overlaid across Australia's vegetation classification scheme (the National Vegetation Information System), and we extracted traits from AusTraits, the most comprehensive regional trait database. 3. Just 113 plant species (<1% of species found in the region) or the combined species of 16 genera make up 50% of the entire vegetation; approximately 10% of species or the combined species from 10% of the genera (1132 species and 140 genera) make up 90% of vegetation cover. Plant trait coverage tended to be higher when expressed as a proportion of vegetation cover than as a proportion of species in the most common woody genera Acacia and Eucalyptus. Gaps in the trait coverage of very common species were obvious, particularly among the grasses of central Australia. Expressing trait coverage weighted by abundance revealed that only a few additional trait measurements of the most common species and genera would be needed to characterise the traits of most of the vegetation in this part of the continent. 4. Synthesis: Our results show that a small fraction of species dominates most of the continent. This means that strategic sampling of a few common yet unsampled species could dramatically boost trait coverage and help address the Raunkiaeran shortfall of traits. Targeting these species would substantially improve ecosystem flux estimates and understanding of successful plant strategies at continental scales, with major benefits for vegetation modelling."

    "content": "Global change and associated disturbances are increasing the risk of regeneration failure for tree species in temperate forests. Seedlings are particularly vulnerable to water stress due to their shallow root systems, making belowground plasticity a potentially key component of species adaptive capacity. Quantifying root trait variability and its drivers can improve our understanding of regeneration success under increasingly warm and dry conditions. We quantified between species variation (BTV) and intraspecific variation (ITV) in seven root traits linked to water uptake, root-to-shoot ratio, maximum rooting depth, proportion of absorptive roots, specific root length, root tissue density, average absorptive root diameter, and root branching density, for seedlings of seven common, co-occurring tree species in forests of northeastern North America. We sampled seedlings under contrasting climate and light conditions, and assessed the influence of abiotic (climate, light conditions, soil properties) and biotic drivers (neighboring vegetation) as well as seedling characteristics (species identity, age, spermatophyte type) on root ITV at local and regional scales. Species differed significantly for some traits but differed even more strongly in multivariate trait syndromes, suggesting distinct belowground strategies. ITV was substantial but trait-dependent, with maximum rooting depth and root to shoot ratio being the most variable (coefficient of variation > 45%) and branching density the least variable. BTV was the primary driver of overall trait variation for three traits, explaining more than 60% of variation, whereas within-plot ITV accounted for more than 50% of variation in the remaining four traits. Local drivers did not outweigh regional factors, and the overall explanatory power of measured drivers was limited, suggesting that fine-scale heterogeneity, not captured in our study, may strongly influence root ITV. High ITV in most traits suggests substantial plasticity in roots, which may contribute to the adaptive capacity of seedlings facing climate change. Integrating this plasticity into mechanistic models is critical for predicting regeneration dynamics or root-mediated ecosystem processes. We propose a set of guidelines for integrating root traits into comparative studies and models based on trait measurability and extent of ITV. We further highlight the need to account for the scale- and gradient-intensity dependence of ITV-environment relationships."

CER2 family proteins further extend the tunnel formed by the KCS6 subunit, thus elongating VLCFAs to chain lengths longer than C28. These findings provide a plant-specific structural framework for VLCFA chain-length modulation and lay a foundation for engineering VLCFA biosynthesis for the improvement of crop resilience and VLCFA industrial value.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Here, we reveal that cancer cells collaboratively reprogram ECM to construct interconnected microchannel networks functioning as \u201csuperhighways\u201d for barrier-free metastasis. Combining live-cell imaging, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers, we decode that the indispensable step in microchannel network construction is organized cross-convergence of adjacent channels. The convergence is precisely directed by mechanical bridges composed of aligned collagen bundles between adjacent channels, which transmit orientation cues to induce multicellular force coordination. Integrating single-cell sequencing and off-lattice agent-based model, we identify mechanically responsive leader cells enriched for integrin-RhoA/YAP signaling and matrix metalloproteinase 14, which sense bridge cues and initiate cross-convergence.

Using a computer vision approach on three-dimensional x-ray microtomography scans of 880 specimens from 507 species, we show that larger colonies were facilitated by reducing exoskeleton investment rather than miniaturizing workers.

One of the most powerful activators of MERVL is the pioneer transcription factor, Dux. However, apparent differences lie in the requirement for Dux versus MERVL activation in embryos. Moreover, sustained Dux activation causes cell toxicity, which may or may not be linked to MERVL. Using a CRISPR activation system, we unpick the relative role of Dux and MERVL in ZGA, totipotent-like characteristics, and cell toxicity.

    "content": "Abstract\nThe biological carbon pump (BCP) transfers CO2 from the surface ocean to depth, helping regulate atmospheric CO2 and accounting for roughly one\u2010third of glacial\u2013interglacial CO2 changes. Its strength is widely estimated from satellite\u2010based relationships between net primary production (NPP) and export efficiency, but these approaches cannot distinguish organic matter rapidly recycled near the surface from that exported to depth. This ambiguity inflates export estimates and obscures BCP variability. Here, using a tracer\u2010constrained inverse biogeochemical model, we explicitly quantify the \u201crapid recycling\u201d fraction of NPP that does not contribute to deep\u2010ocean sequestration. We find that \u223c48%\u201360% of satellite\u2010measured NPP is respired within the euphotic zone within hours to days, leaving a climatological mean carbon export of 13.72\u201315.55 Pg C\u00a0yr\u22121\u2014consistent across multiple satellite NPP products. Export fluxes derived from our inverse model agree more closely with sediment trap and 234Th observations than those from empirical NPP\u2013export relationships or Earth system models. Of course, the inverse model's steady\u2010state assumption and dependence on a low\u2010resolution climatological circulation field prevent future predictions and limit its accuracy in coastal and polar regions. These results still show that deep\u2010ocean tracer constraints yield robust BCP estimates despite large surface productivity uncertainties, and they provide the first global\u2010scale quantification of rapid surface recycling as a major limitation of satellite\u2010based export assessments."

Hydrodynamic resuspension regulates OC content through grain\u2010size and mineral sorting but does not directly alter its thermochemical properties, regardless of hydrodynamic intensity.

    "content": "Abstract\nThe eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP) plays a critical role in the global climate system through widespread CO2 outgassing and cool sea surface temperatures (SST) that occur due to persistent Ekman suction (upwelling). The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2014situated on the equator in the EEP\u2014disrupt the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), causing strong upwelling on its western boundary and an SST minimum referred to as the Gal\u00e1pagos Cold Pool (GCP). This study analyzes the ocean mixed layer heat budget of the GCP relative to an open\u2010ocean region in the EEP using a 140\u2010year present day simulation of a high\u2010resolution (0.1\u00b0 ocean) version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), version 1.2.2. We diagnose the contributions of each heat budget term with emphasis on vertical advection and eddy diffusion\u2014hypothesized to be important near the Gal\u00e1pagos. Our results distinguish the seasonal heat balance in the GCP from the open ocean in the EEP. The net surface heat flux in the cold tongue is balanced primarily by vertical mixing, vertical advection dominates in the GCP. A variety of processes that vary throughout El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases are also important within the GCP, including changes to vertical and horizontal advection and vertical mixing, leading to associated SST anomalies. A thorough understanding of these processes and their contribution to the surface heat balance is essential in understanding the formation of the GCP, its interaction with the atmosphere, and its potential response to climate change with implications for this climatically and ecologically vital region."

    "content": "Abstract\nSubduction and obduction are water mass exchanges between the ocean mixed layer (ML) and the permanent pycnocline. Knowledge of how they change in a warming climate is of great importance to anticipating how warming will affect material circulation and biogeochemistry. We investigated interannual variations of annual subduction and obduction rates (Sann and Oann) over the North Pacific Ocean using an eddy\u2010resolving ocean reanalysis. Both Sann and Oann integrated over the basin increased during the last few decades. The volumes of subducted and obducted water parcels increased in most of the potential density range, and the regions where the volumes were large shifted northward after 2004. These increases of Sann and Oann were especially large north of the Kuroshio Extension (KE), despite a decrease of the potential density of the winter ML. The failure of the trends of either Sann or Oann to increase when mesoscale spatial variations were filtered out was consistent with calculations using a gridded product based on in situ observations, implying that eddy activity was responsible for the trends. The variations of Sann and Oann corresponded closely with that of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) north of the KE. This implies that northward migration of the KE increased available potential energy, thereby elevating EKE through baroclinic conversion. Warm eddies especially enhanced subduction and obduction. These results suggest that these processes activated vertical exchanges of water masses and materials, thereby surpassing enhanced stratification due to warming of the upper ocean."

Here, we present ASPEN, a statistical method for modeling allelic mean and variance in single-cell transcriptomic data from F1 hybrids. ASPEN combines a sensitive mapping pipeline and adaptive shrinkage to distinguish allelic imbalance and allelic variance in single cells. In both simulated and empirical datasets, ASPEN achieves a 30% increase in sensitivity over existing approaches for single cell allelic imbalance detection. Applied to mouse brain organoids and T cells, ASPEN identifies genes with incomplete X inactivation, stochastic monoallelic expression, and significant deviations in allelic variance. These results reveal reduced variance in essential pathways and increased variance at neurodevelopmental and immune genes."

    "content": "<p>by Fen Yan, ZhiHua Du, Yu-An Huang</p>\n\nDeveloping computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction."

Cloud computing has democratised large-scale resources, and to reduce the barriers of working with large-scale compute, leading cloud vendors offer serverless computing, a low-maintenance and low-cost model that provides ample resources for highly scalable software applications. While serverless computing has broad use, its adoption in bioinformatics remains poor. Here, we demonstrate the most extensive use of high-performance serverless computing for bioinformatics by applying the available technologies to CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) design. Our adaptation of the established gRNA design tool, named Crackling, implements a novel, cloud-native and serverless-based, high-performance computing environment using technologies made available by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture, compatible with technologies from all leading cloud vendors, and the AWS implementation, contributes to an effort of reducing the barrier to large computational capacity in bioinformatics and for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design.

    "content": "<p>by Lan Yang, Jiayu Lu, Xinran Wu, Xi Zhang, Ting Li, Ruiyun Chang, Songjun Peng, Dandan Li, Jie Zhang, Bin Wang</p>\n\nAccurate simulation of the\u00a0brain\u2019s\u00a0intrinsic dynamic activity is essential for understanding human cognition and behavior and developing personalized brain disease therapies. Traditional neurodynamics models depend on structural connectivity to explain the emergence of functional connectivity (FC). However, achieving high-fidelity simulations at the individual level remains challenging, as the models fail to fully capture the brain information. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable\u00a0Individualized\u00a0Brain Computing Model (SI-BCM), a data-driven reverse engineering framework designed to infer spatiotemporal co-activity patterns from fMRI data for simulating whole-brain activity. This model captures the dynamic interactions between brain regions by integrating spatiotemporal dimensional information to extract a stable and shared connectivity pattern, representing the intrinsic functional collaboration pattern of the brain. This connectivity pattern is then used as the core connection weight in the dynamical system. Additionally, the model has a new cost function based on the Phase-Space Association matrix (PSA), enhancing its ability to capture brain activity dynamics. This combination enables the SI-BCM to improve simulation accuracy at the individual level compared to existing models, achieving a correlation coefficient between simulated and empirical FC of 0.87. The SI-BCM also showed enhanced robustness and reliability, and effectively captured brain properties. We found the model sensitively reflected changes in cognitive function, thereby providing valuable insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the application of SI-BCM in the brain modeling of\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s\u00a0disease (AD) patients substantiated the hypothesis that AD pathogenesis may be due to excessive neuronal excitation. This work establishes a new paradigm for brain network modeling by prioritizing the inference of stable dynamics features from activity data, providing a powerful tool for understanding brain function and pathophysiology."

However, the analysis of eDNA datasets is limited by incomplete reference databases and the increasing volume of data requiring processing from raw sequences to annotated taxonomic lists. To detect unexpected taxa in eDNA analysis, geographic priors are incorporated through expert post-analysis, which may introduce potential biases in assignments. Instead of relying on expert intervention, a combination of taxonomic and geographic co-occurrences could be directly integrated into machine learning to automatize and improve taxonomic annotation. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences, which leverages a species reference database, species co-occurrence data, and a phylogeny to enhance annotation directly from raw sequences. The phylogeny provides the structure to the network\u2019s embedding space in which DNA sequences are placed utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN). We train an additional ANN from the phylogenetic embedding and co-occurrence species data to learn coherent species combinations from the whole collection of eDNA sequences, as opposed to single sequences only. When applied directly to the raw sequences, this method correctly predicts unseen species (i.e., those not contained in the reference database), out of more than 31,000 possibilities, in about 24% of the tested cases by relying on phylogenetic embeddings and geographic modulation. The trained ANNs discern species relationships accurately from the raw data, which facilitates the process of associating sequences with taxa\u2014even those absent from reference databases. When we use real eDNA samples, our predictions mostly agree with those from a traditional bioinformatic pipeline, highlighting the potential of our method for the annotation of the increasing number of eDNA sequences."

In this study, we identify peroxisomal dysfunction as a critical driver of age-associated ISC mis-differentiation. Using <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse colonic organoids, we demonstrate that reduced PEX5 expression in aged ISCs impairs peroxisomal matrix protein import, leading to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulation. In addition, we found that RAB7-dependent late endosome maturation and SOX21A were downstream of the peroxisome in controlling aged ISC differentiation. Aspirin, a classic anti-inflammatory drug, restores ISC lineage fidelity by enhancing PEX5-mediated peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation of VLCFAs. Taken together, these findings highlight peroxisomal dysfunction and VLCFA metabolism as pivotal regulators of ISC aging and suggest new therapeutic strategies for combating age-related intestinal decline."

We demonstrate that a cross\u2010Pacific Rossby wave train, triggered by strong latent heat release due to increased precipitation of ECs, can transport substantial energy toward North America (NA). Consequently, an anomalous quasi\u2010barotropic ridge (trough) forms over the North Pacific (NA). Between them, northerly anomalies lead to cold advection over NA, associated with a negative air thickness anomaly, causing widespread cold anomalies there. Our findings, supported by observations and model experiments, provide novel insights into the downstream effect of ECs, including a potential source of extended\u2010range predictability for NA temperatures during the Fall season."

    "content": "Abstract\nTropical America (TAM) is typically humid but has recently experienced frequent droughts. Using 42 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we show that amplified equatorial Pacific warming induces a Gill\u2010type atmospheric response that suppresses precipitation across TAM by weakening ascent, explaining over half of the inter\u2010model spread in projected rainfall changes. The magnitude of projected TAM drying depends strongly on the simulated present\u2010day zonal sea surface temperature gradient over the tropical Pacific, but climate models systematically underestimate this gradient, likely leading to an underestimation of equatorial Pacific warming and TAM drying. An emergent constraint suggests a regional mean annual rainfall decline of 46\u00a0mm over TAM per 1\u00a0K of global warming, approximately 1.5 times the raw projection, with a 30% reduction in uncertainty.

    "content": "Abstract\nShallow lakes and ponds play a crucial role in the processing of carbon and other nutrients. However, many lakes and ponds worldwide are affected by climate change and nutrient pollution. How these pressures affect the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is unclear. Warming and eutrophication are expected to increase the production and emission of N2O in lakes and ponds, but changes in ecological structure and function may complicate these seemingly straightforward relationships. In this study, we used the world's longest running, mesocosm\u2010based, freshwater climate change experiment to disentangle the effect of nutrient enrichment and warming on N2O emissions. We gathered a large dataset on N2O concentrations and ancillary variables, comprising three sampling campaigns between 2011 and 2020 and a total of 687 individual mesocosm measurements. Our results demonstrated that nutrient enrichment increased N2O emissions, while warming (+2.5\u20134.0\u00b0C and +3.75\u20136.0\u00b0C) had no discernable effect. Our study indicates that curtailing nitrogen influxes into lakes and ponds is the most effective strategy to minimize N2O emissions, and while warming may influence N2O emissions, it does not appear to be a direct driver. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing nitrogen mitigation efforts to curb N2O emissions from shallow lakes and ponds."

    "content": "Abstract\nSeagrasses are important foundation species, which support coastal biodiversity and provide socioeconomic benefits. However, seagrasses are threatened by anthropogenic changes, including the elevated temperature associated with marine heatwaves (MHWs) and light limitation from eutrophication or increased sedimentation. In this experiment, we exposed the seagrass Halophila ovalis to 10\u2010d of elevated temperature, simulating a MHW, and three light intensities to examine the impacts on multiple levels of organization, that is, growth, productivity, nitrogen cycling, and leaf microbiome. We found that both the MHW temperature and decreased light independently negatively impacted seagrass growth of new leaves, with decreased light also reducing new leaf area and rhizome elongation rate, and the occurrence of MHW temperatures increasing the rate of leaf loss. Similarly, chlorophyll concentration was altered by both stressors independently, with a common response to reduced light (increased chlorophyll concentration) significantly lower under the MHW temperature. Nitrogen assimilation rate into the leaves also decreased under both MHW temperature and reduced light availability. The leaf microbiome shifted in response to the MHW temperature and lower light, with these conditions prompting relatively more anaerobic microbes but less oxidative stress\u2010tolerant bacteria, and less prokaryotes performing phototrophy and (oxygenic) photoautotrophy. In conclusion, we show elevated temperature representing a MHW and light limitation can drive decreased seagrass growth, chlorophyll concentration, and cause shifts in leaf microbial functional groups, although there was little interaction between stressors. It is therefore important that good water clarity and habitat health is maintained to reduce the susceptibility of seagrasses to extreme climatic events."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change is projected to cause elevated precipitation in northern Europe, leading to increased runoff of terrestrial matter to coastal areas. The consequences for food web production and ecosystem function remain unclear. A mesocosm experiment was performed to investigate the impacts of elevated terrestrial matter input, using a natural plankton community from the northern Baltic Sea with added young\u2010of\u2010the\u2010year perch as planktivorous top consumer. Addition of terrestrial matter caused water browning and increased dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrient concentrations. Phytoplankton primary production showed a negative response to terrestrial matter due to decreased light availability, while heterotrophic bacterial production increased. The trophic balance, calculated as the difference between primary production and heterotrophic bacterial production, indicated that net\u2010heterotrophy was triggered by terrestrial matter enrichment. Primary production was identified as the main basal energy source for fish. Addition of terrestrial matter reduced the food web efficiency, calculated as the ratio between fish production and basal production (primary production\u2009+\u2009heterotrophic bacterial production). Furthermore, stable isotope analysis of seston and fish indicated that the added terrestrial matter was not efficiently incorporated in the food web and only marginally altered the food web trophic positions. The results suggest that the main food chain consisted of phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, and fish, and that the ecosystem production was overall light driven. Under a changing climate, several negative effects can be expected, including a poorer light climate, reduced ecosystem production and net\u2010heterotrophy. These alterations have potentially significant consequences for ecosystem functioning, fish production, and thus ecosystem services."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and stochasticity of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, storm\u2010induced mixing, or prolonged drought periods. This results in more variable regimes of dissolved nutrients and carbon in lakes and induces temporal fluctuations in the resource availability for plankton communities, which can further lead to changes in growth and the cellular ratio of essential elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. However, the current understanding of the effects of variations in regularity and frequency of precipitation events on both producer and consumer levels is limited by the lack of experimental studies examining processes at multiple trophic levels. In our mesocosm study, we added the same total amount of nitrate, phosphate, and colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) to each mesocosm at pulses differing in frequency (daily, intermittent, or one extreme addition) and regularity (regular, irregular) over a simulated run\u2010off period followed by a recovery period. Our results showed that phytoplankton biomass fully recovered to control conditions from one extreme nutrient and cDOM pulse, whereas pulses of higher frequency gradually increased the biomass. In terms of stoichiometry, the extreme pulse led to the lowest stability in particulate C\u2009:\u2009P and N\u2009:\u2009P ratios. At the zooplankton level, copepod biomass decreased across all nutrient and cDOM additions, but no effects between the treatments were found. Overall, our study demonstrates that phytoplankton stability depends on the regularity and frequency of nutrient additions and differs substantially between biomass and stoichiometry, but the effects may be buffered on zooplankton level."

    "content": "Abstract\nMarine heatwaves are increasing globally in intensity and duration. To investigate the potential consequences for coastal ecosystems, the effects of short\u2010term heat stress must be better understood. This study examined eco\u2010physiological responses in two common intertidal bivalves, Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica, to different heatwave intensities in a mesocosm experiment under near\u2010natural environmental conditions. Single\u2010species assemblages were exposed to a 15\u2010d heatwave of either\u2009+2.8\u00b0C (mild heatwave) or\u2009+4.4\u00b0C (strong heatwave) above ambient temperatures. Survival and condition were monitored, and filtration rates were measured before and during heatwave exposure to investigate feeding behavior. Bivalve respiration rates were measured before, during, and after heatwave exposure as a proxy for metabolic responses. For C. edule, we found significantly elevated filtration rates during the mild but not the strong heatwave. For M. balthica, survival was similar across treatments, but marine heatwaves had a significant effect on the condition index (tissue/shell mass ratio). During heatwave exposure, respiration rates were similar across treatments for both species. However, following the heatwaves, bivalves previously exposed to a strong heatwave showed lower respiration rates compared to those exposed to an ambient or a mild heatwave. This study revealed that short\u2010term heatwaves can have persisting negative effects on bivalve metabolism and that the two species responded differently to the heatwave intensities. Further research is needed on the potential long\u2010term effects of marine heatwaves on intertidal fauna and their capacity to continue providing crucial ecosystem services."

    "content": "Abstract\nEutrophication in the Baltic Sea has caused an imbalance in the inorganic nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratio, leaving excess phosphate (PO4) after the phytoplankton spring bloom that terminates after N depletion. Using monitoring data, we demonstrated that the PO4 concentration has continued to increase in the outermost Gulf of Finland during past decades. We further investigated the fate of such excess PO4 in a two\u2010week mesocosm (1.2\u2009m3) experiment. The starting concentration of PO4 was 0.66\u2009\u03bcM, and treatments included a non\u2010treated control (control), nitrate addition (N\u2010add; 3.6\u2009\u03bcM), glucose addition (C\u2010add; 36\u2009\u03bcM) and combined nitrate and glucose addition (N\u2009+\u2009C\u2010add). The addition of N, both in N\u2010add and N\u2009+\u2009C\u2010add treatments, stimulated nano\u2010 and microphytoplankton, while the picophytoplankton abundance increased after N depletion. Also, the copepod biomass was positively affected by the N addition. N2\u2010fixing cyanobacteria were present but in low abundance. Carbon addition did not enhance heterotrophic bacterial uptake of PO4 contrary to our expectations, nor did it affect the phyto\u2010 or zooplankton community composition. The PO4 concentration was reduced to\u2009~\u20090.4\u2009\u03bcM in the control and C\u2010add treatments and to 0.16\u2009\u03bcM in the two N\u2010amended treatments, with an inorganic N\u2009:\u2009P uptake ratio of 6.7. These results underscore the role of picophytoplankton in reducing the excess PO4 pool after the spring bloom, a function traditionally ascribed to bloom\u2010forming filamentous cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea."

    "content": "Abstract\nSpatial environmental heterogeneity is an important driver of aquatic biodiversity. Ecological and evolutionary theory often consider spatial heterogeneity as being driven by exogenous factors, yet heterogeneity can also be generated and modified by organisms. Here we used a mesocosm experiment to investigate if consumers influence the build\u2010up of spatial heterogeneity. We expected that consumer effects on heterogeneity would depend on consumer composition and differ among response variables. We constructed metacommunities consisting of three mesocosms and manipulated the presence and composition of consumers, using four treatment levels: (1) no consumers, (2) two genotypes of Daphnia galeata, (3) D. galeata and Daphnia longispina, and (4) D. galeata and a hybrid of D. galeata\u2009\u00d7\u2009D. longispina. We then continuously increased heterogeneity among the three patches of each metacommunity by adding nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), respectively, to two of the three mesocosms. We found that consumers affected the build\u2010up of heterogeneity, but the direction and magnitude of this effect differed among consumer compositions. Metacommunities with only D. galeata had increased heterogeneity in phytoplankton biomass, whereas metacommunities with D. longispina or the hybrid had low phytoplankton heterogeneity. The differential effects of Daphnia taxa on phytoplankton heterogeneity cascaded down to the abiotic environment and resulted in taxon\u2010specific effects on heterogeneity in light extinction, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and total inorganic carbon. Our results imply that changes in consumer species (e.g., due to environmental change or invasion) might affect not only the local environment but could also impact heterogeneity among environments, with important consequences for aquatic biodiversity."

Within the applied driver ranges, elevated temperature had the most pronounced impacts, significantly increasing growth (~\u200940%) and particulate organic carbon production (up to ~\u2009140%). Light stimulations manifested prominently under high temperature (~\u200930\u201335%), underlining its role as a \u201cmaster\u2010variable.\u201d pCO2 was the least effective driver, exerting mostly insignificant effects. The obtained data were used for a simplistic upscaling simulation to investigate potential changes in Isochrysis' bloom dynamics in the Fram Strait with increasing temperatures over the 21st century. Results suggest that global warming will accelerate bloom dynamics, with earlier onsets of blooms and higher peak biomasses. Despite remaining uncertainties about the magnitude of these effects, data strongly suggest that increasing temperatures over the coming century will affect the phenology of Isochrysis and other Arctic phytoplankton with likely important implications for higher trophic levels."

    "content": "Circadian metabolism arises from complex, time-dependent interactions across organs, yet experimental characterization in humans remains limited. Current whole-body metabolic models are either too large for dynamic simulation or insufficiently detailed to capture temporal physiology. We developed a multi-tissue human metabolic reconstruction, HGEM1.19+, an extensively curated model for dynamic simulation. We introduced Thermo-Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (tdFBA), a novel formulation that integrates thermodynamic constraints, organ-specific enzyme capacities, solubility limits, osmotic balance and pH buffering. Murine circadian transcriptomics and metabolomics were integrated with human datasets to parameterize temporal dynamics. A genetic algorithm optimized internal parameters under CHOW diet conditions and model performance was evaluated using circadian metabolomics and gene-sage patterns. The framework recapitulated key metabolic oscillations under CHOW diet and partially reconstructed perturbed states including HFD, BMAL1 knockout, and tissue-specific re-entrainment. tdFBA enables physiologically grounded, multi-organ dynamic simulations and provides a foundation for exploring human circadian metabolism and perturbation responses."

Here, we present an optimized scProteomic workflow that enhances proteome coverage and quantification by refining liquid chromatography (LC) conditions across platforms (both Evosep and nanoElute2). Importantly, our results show that using our optimized LC conditions, even with Bruker timsTOF HT, a machine not designed for scProteomics applications, we achieved solid performance with single cell samples that allows meaningful biological discoveries. First, we compared power to detect differentially-expressed genes/proteins between scRNA-seq and scProteomics at single cell level, and demonstrated that scProteomics showed an excellent performance at small sample sizes. To further validate this finding, we applied our optimized workflow to study the proteomic response to oxidative stress using a limited number of single cells. Our scProteomics results successfully detected 3 distinct cell populations, reflecting correctly the 3 cell lines used, and captured the dysregulation of antioxidant enzymes, molecular chaperones and ubiquitin-proteasome system, reflecting a multi-faceted response to oxidative stress that is uniform across distinct cell lines. Our results highlighted the potential of scProteomics to resolve subtle perturbations and provide a readout of cellular states for the broader community, including users operating non-scProteomics-dedicated machines."

    "content": "Vasopressin regulates transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene (Aqp2) in collecting duct principal cells. To investigate regulatory mechanisms in Aqp2 gene transcription, we engineered an Aqp2 reporter cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 to insert a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette at the endogenous Aqp2 gene locus in mpkCCD cells. In the absence of dDAVP, a vasopressin analog, these cells exhibited low or undetectable GFP and Aqp2 expression in all cells. dDAVP stimulation (1nM dDAVP for 48hrs) markedly increased both GFP and Aqp2 expression together with reversal upon dDAVP removal. These observations demonstrate that GFP faithfully tracks Aqp2 expression. Interestingly, fewer than 50% of cells express GFP and Aqp2 after dDAVP or forskolin, indicating significant variability even though they were clonally-derived. We flow-sorted the GFP- cells (Aqp2-) and GFP+ cells (Aqp2+), regrew them, and restimulated them separately with dDAVP. Cells originating from GFP- cells gave rise to both GFP- cells and GFP+ cells, and GFP+ cells similarly regenerated both GFP- and GFP+ populations in the same proportion. Flow cytometry analysis of the DNA content showed variability in cell cycle phases, with most GFP+ cells in G0/G1, and more GFP- cells in G2/S. RNA-seq analysis of the GFP- and GFP+ cells revealed increased abundance of cell-cycle related transcripts in the GFP- cells. We conclude that: 1) heterogeneity in Aqp2 expression is related to cell cycle state; and 2) the newly generated reporter cell line will likely serve as a useful tool to study Aqp2 transcriptional regulation."

    "content": "While overlooked during the Human Microbiome Project, characterizing the urinary microbiota in health and disease is a new frontier in microbiome science. Recent studies have associated differential abundance of bacterial taxa including Propionimicrobium lymphophilum and Actinobaculum/Actinotignum spp. with prostate cancer. In this study, we collected urine from subjects prior to prostate biopsy and applied a novel Human Sterolbiome Discovery High-throughput (HSDH) assay to identify culturable urinary bacteria with the ability to generate androgens. Application of the HSDH assay to urine samples led to the isolation of eight P. lymphophilum strains positive for cortisol side-chain cleavage (steroid-17,20-desmolase), 17{beta}-HSDH activity, or both. In addition, we isolated three strains of Actinobaculum massiliense that encode DHEA isomerase reductase (dir) genes. The dirA gene encodes a novel 3{beta}/17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/{Delta}4,5-isomerase and the dirB gene encodes a novel 17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoform. Structural prediction and molecular dynamics reveal probable catalytic mechanisms based on the shared catalytic triad but distinct binding pocket geometries of the DirA and DirB that describe their respective reactions. Phylogenetic analysis of DirA and DirB revealed homologs in urinary tract commensals as well as bacteria associated with steroid degradation found in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Taken together, the development of the HSDH assay and the identification of the dir pathway genes is a significant advance in microbial endocrinology, laying the methodological foundation and providing the molecular basis for understanding the role of urinary tract bacteria in host endocrine physiology."

    "content": "Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are capable of accumulating and storing intercellular pools containing phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and carbon. Yet, the metabolic pathways connected with their intracellular storage of polyphosphate, elemental sulfur, nitrate, and calcium carbonate, and the environmental influence on MTB inclusions and their quantitative contribution to sedimentary chemical budgets remain underexplored. Using a combination of chemical characterization, ultrastructural and compositional analyses, and phylogenetic and genomic insights into microbial assemblages, we investigated the influence of geochemical parameters on the diversity, ecophysiology, and distribution of MTB in freshwater and brackish sediments. Special focus is given to intracellular inclusions and their metabolic pathways to uncover functional traits and ecological roles in elemental cycling. Of the 118 examined MTB cells, polyphosphate granules (75%) and nitrate-containing vacuoles (67%) were the most common inclusions followed by sulfur globules (25%) and calcium carbonate granules (8%). The intracellular phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur stored in MTB cells were conservatively estimated to account for 0.60%, 0.91%, and 0.23% of the total sedimentary P, N, and S in the investigated freshwater sediments, respectively. The ubiquitous nature and important ecological role of MTB can be explained by their ability to sequester chemical elements into intracellular inclusions, giving them a metabolic advantage in dynamic chemically stratified environments. The extraordinary phylogenetic diversity of MTB, coupled with their capability to hyperaccumulate and store a wide range of elements and compounds, represents a significant resource for biotechnology innovation."

    "content": "Yeasts are widespread members of microbial communities across terrestrial, aquatic, and host-associated environments, yet they remain underrepresented in microbiome studies due to low abundance and methodological biases. By combining a literature review with a meta-analysis of ~44,000 fungal metabarcoding samples from the GlobalFungi database, we show that yeasts occur in over 90% of samples, confirming their global ubiquity. Basidiomycetous lineages-especially Agaricomycotina-were most frequently detected, whereas Saccharomycotina were more restricted to anthropogenic and aquatic settings. Although yeasts typically comprised only ~0.1% of fungal reads, their distributions were non-random and reflected distinct habitat preferences across environments. In ~3% of samples, yeasts exceeded 25% of reads, with genera such as Aureobasidium, Hanseniaspora, and Saccharomyces episodically dominating nutrient-rich or human-influenced environments. Cosmopolitan genera including Vishniacozyma, Solicoccozyma, and Rhodotorula were broadly distributed but remain underreported in microbiome surveys. Shotgun metagenomic data further confirmed yeast presence across diverse microbiomes, though with consistently low coverage, reflecting the \"curse of low abundance.\" Despite their rarity, yeasts likely play disproportionate roles in nutrient cycling, plant growth, and host interactions. We recommend inclusive multi-kingdom approaches-improved primers, long-read sequencing, and quantitative tools-to better integrate yeasts in microbiomes."

    "content": "The global spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious public health concern, driven by widespread antibiotic use and the global environmental circulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes (ARGs). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important sources of anthropogenic AMR entering large rivers, which serve as vital water resources but facilitate downstream dissemination. The drivers and dynamics of AMR propagation along river systems remain poorly understood. As Switzerland's longest and one of its largest rivers, the Aare, situated in the upper Rhine watershed, plays a central role in the 'water castle of Europe'. This study examines the impact of WWTP discharges, some receiving high loads of hospital effluent, on ARG distribution along the 288 km Aare river-continuum. Using quantitative PCR targeting 14 ARGs conferring resistance to eight antibiotic classes, combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we conducted a high-resolution spatial survey to assess shifts in the riverine resistome and microbiome. Concentrations of trace metals and nutrients were analyzed as tracers of anthropogenic inputs. Results revealed a progressive increase in ARG abundance downstream, driven by WWTP effluents enriched in ARGs. Effluents had 70-fold higher mean ARG concentrations than upstream waters, raising downstream levels up to 141-fold. Major tributaries such as the Reuss and Limmat sustained elevated ARG levels, while passage through lakes markedly reduced concentrations. This study provides the first detailed baseline for ARG prevalence along a large river system, from pristine headwaters to pollution-affected lower reaches and insights into aquatic AMR dynamics and guidance for future monitoring."

In Gram-positive bacteria, T4SSs have long been thought to lack VirB2-like proteins that form conjugative pili and instead rely on adhesins for cell-cell contacts. Yet, it has remained unclear how subsequent DNA transfer (conjugation) is physically mediated. Here we identify a VirB2-like protein, PrgFB2, from the clinically isolated conjugative plasmid pCF10 in Enteroccocus faecalis and show that it is essential for conjugation. Structural modeling confidently predicts a pilus-like assembly for PrgFB2. We validate this prediction through mutagenesis, conjugation assays, and targeted chemical labeling. By combining various machine learning bioinformatic techniques, we analysed >1000 Gram-positive conjugative plasmids from diverse species, including major pathogens, and identified pili forming VirB2-like proteins in almost all of them. Our findings overturn the prevailing view that Gram-positive T4SSs lack pili. This discovery provides a new framework for understanding horizontal gene transfer and highlights critical targets for combating antimicrobial resistance and virulence in Gram-positive bacteria."

    "content": "Rhizosphere microorganisms are known to be able to modify the plant's ability to resist abiotic stresses. It is, however, difficult to modify microbial communities to improve plant phenotypes. Here we tested if a rhizosphere microbial community from a water-stress naive soil could be modified by adding DNA extracted from soils with a water stress history. Six-week-old wheat plants growing under low or high-water availabilities were inoculated with DNA extracted from soils with contrasting long-term histories of water availability - one continuously and the other intermittently exposed to water deficit. The fate of the inoculated DNA in the rhizosphere microbial communities was assessed by shotgun metagenomics. Putatively transferred inoculum genes were disproportionately found in the Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes and belonged to functional category such as antibiotics, biofilm, and carboxylates metabolism, among others. These functional categories were shared by pre-inoculation laterally transferred genes in the recipient soil, highlighting their usefulness for life in soil. The \"continuous\" inoculum reduced the stress levels of wheat under reduced soil water content, suggesting that the natural genetic transformation of the rhizosphere community can feedback to the plant. Altogether, we are providing evidence for an ecological mechanism that could be harnessed to modify plant-associated microbial communities and help plants sustain water stress."

The limited availability of antiviral drugs, the unproven efficacy in humans, and the emergence of resistant mutants underscore the need for new and better therapeutics. In this study, we identify and characterize ZW-2038, a hydroxypyridone-3-carboxamide analog, as an antiviral compound against vaccinia virus (VACV), monkeypox virus (MPXV), and cowpox virus (CPXV). Discovered through a focused in-house small-molecule screen, ZW-2038 exhibited low micromolar potency and high selectivity in primary human fibroblasts. The compound also reduced viral replication under physiomimetic conditions including human and monkey intestinal organoids (enteroids) and ex vivo mouse lung tissue models. Mechanistically, ZW-2038 suppresses VACV DNA replication and downstream post-replicative gene expression, albeit without inhibiting MPXV resolvase (Mpr) in vitro. These findings, along with in vitro safety profiling and mice pharmacokinetics studies, characterize ZW-2038 as a promising yet suboptimal antiviral lead against orthopoxviruses warranting future development."

    "content": "Under nutrient starvation conditions, many microorganisms such as Pseudomonas putida store excess carbon in medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) granules. Biosynthesis of PHAs from the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway requires PhaG, which has long been thought to encode a 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP:CoA transferase, and PhaC, the PHA polymerase. Although this pathway has been extensively studied, the exact role of PhaG remains inconclusive. In this work we present in vitro biochemical and in vivo genetic evidence demonstrating that PhaG functions as a 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP thiolase, producing 3-hydroxyacids rather than 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. We identified two CoA ligases, fadD1 and alkK, essential for conversion of mcl-3-hydroxyacids to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, and thus PHA production. Taken together, this redefines the PHA biosynthetic pathway to include PhaG-dependent hydrolysis of hydroxyacyl-ACP, ligation of the 3-hydroxyacid to coenzyme-A, and polymerization by PhaC. Using these insights, we engineered P. putida to produce 3.7 g/L extracellular 3-hydroxyacids, which can be used for chemical synthesis of performance-advantaged polymers."

Already more than 30 years ago, IE1 was described to bind to mitotic chromosomes, however the implications of this finding have yet to be determined. HCMV can infect a wide range of cell types and was also detected in different tumours; however, the majority of molecular studies relating to this virus are performed in fibroblasts or monocytic cells. We examined the localization of HCMV IE1 across multiple cell types, including tumour cell lines, to better understand how the protein behaves in these cellular contexts. IE1 is one of the first HCMV genes expressed after lytic infection of the cell and it was observed to distribute evenly over the chromosomes in so-called 'chromosome painting' pattern. In leukemia and glioblastoma cells we detected a novel mitotic localization pattern of IE1 - in chromosome-associated spots (CAS), in addition to 'painting the chromosomes', as reported before. We demonstrate that the IE1 core domain mediates CAS localization and that the distribution pattern of IE1 on mitotic chromosomes is influenced by both the cell type being infected and the level of IE1 expression. The novel CAS localization of IE1 suggests a new, possibly cell-type specific function of this protein, distinct from its role in transcriptional regulation."

We studied its Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (MSMEG) homologue, MSMEG_1353, using a CRISPRi conditional knockdown. MSMEG_1353 depletion increased cell width and volume, delayed log-phase initiation, slowed aggregation, reduced biofilm formation, and heightened susceptibility to antibiotics and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). AlphaFold, sequence alignment, and UNIPROT analyses suggest MSMEG_1353 functions as a protein kinase, with conserved residues in intermediate high-confidence regions potentially forming an ATP-binding site. Investigating its role in cell envelope biosynthesis, mass spectrometry revealed elevated levels of mycolic acid biosynthesis proteins upon MSMEG_1353 knockdown. RT-qPCR confirmed upregulation of the fabD-acpM-kasA-KasB-accD6 operon, encoding key mycolic acid synthesis enzymes. Notably, a strong negative correlation with MSMEG_0911, the predominant isocitrate lyase, important in the glyoxylate cycle, was observed via both MS and RT-qPCR. Collectively, MSMEG_1353 deficiency compromises cell wall integrity, likely due to altered lipid composition resulting from dysregulated mycolic acid biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. These findings support the development of models explaining MSMEG_1353's involvement in these pathways."

This study compared the inactivation efficacy of ultraviolet C irradiation at 254 nm (UV 254) and far-UVC radiation at 222 nm (UV 222) against four hNoV strains and two surrogate viruses, Tulane virus (TV) and bacteriophage MS2. A symptom scoring assay was developed to assess hNoV infectivity following microinjection into zebrafish embryos, being used in combination with reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), long-range RT-qPCR, and RNase-treated RT-qPCR. With a general laboratory set-up of viruses being suspended in deionized water droplets in Petri dish, UV 222 was demonstrated with comparable, if not superior, performance in reducing hNoV infectivity and RNA integrity, and was significantly more effective than UV 254 in damaging viral capsids. MS2 exhibited inactivation patterns similar to hNoVs, whereas TV was markedly more resistant to UV 222. The performance of UV 222 was consistent in inactivating hydrated viruses on both stainless steel and porcine skin surfaces. However, the efficacy of UV-222 was substantially more reduced when virus inocula were dried or mixed with simulated vomitus containing high levels of organic matter, compared with UV-254. No evidence of viral adaptation or persistent genomic diversification was detected following repeated sublethal UV exposures. Taken together, UV 222 can be regarded as a promising technology in surface disinfection, especially for hNoV control, meantime keeping safe for human exposure."

    "content": "Mosquito larvae rely on a living microbiota for normal development because the microbiota supplies essential nutrients, particularly vitamins. Beyond vitamin provision, transcriptomic data suggest that the microbiota also supports other key nutritional processes. Here, we explored these roles by conducting a metabolomics analysis on Aedes aegypti third instar larvae following microbiota depletion. We sampled larvae and dissected guts 12- and 20-hours post-decolonization and analysed methanol-soluble metabolites using untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal a pronounced impact of gut microbial presence on several metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the uricolytic pathway. Germ-free larvae also had a lower quantity of cholesterol in guts and their long-chain fatty acid profile was altered in guts and whole larvae. Sterols, including cholesterol, are essential precursors for the production of the moulting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. We therefore tested how supplementing exogenous cholesterol affects the development of germ-free larvae. The effects proved to be highly concentration-dependent, ranging from a marginally significant increase in successful development to adulthood at low concentrations to a pronounced developmental impairment at higher concentrations. Moreover, bacteria deficient in fatty acids beta-oxidation had a significantly lower ability to support larval development. Together, the observed alterations suggest that microbiota-deprived larvae exhibit a downregulation of metabolic processes related to energy production, nitrogen excretion and sterol metabolism, likely due to the absence of microbiota-derived vitamins essential for these central metabolic functions."

To evaluate the circulation and co-infection rates of five Anaplasma species (A. ovis, A. capra, A. bovis, A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum) in asymptomatic small ruminants in Corsica - a Mediterranean island of France - we designed a singleplex, duplex, and multiplex nested PCR (nPCR) scheme based on the gltA gene. Anaplasmosis was found to be highly endemic on the island, with 85.2% of the tested small ruminants infected by one or more Anaplasma species (82.8% of sheep and 89.5% of goats). We confirmed the presence of A. ovis and A. capra, and, for the first time in Corsica, detected A. bovis and A. phagocytophilum in both sheep (respective infection rates: 64.3%, 34.3%, 4.3%, and 7.1%) and goats (respective rates: 84.2%, 13.2%, 18.4%, and 5.3%). A. marginale was not detected. Approximately one-third of the infected animals were co-infected (35.1% of infected sheep and 32.4% of infected goats). A. ovis was always involved in co-infections, most often associated with A. capra (54.8% of co-infections). Importantly, A. bovis was never detected as a mono-infection in asymptomatic animals, but was always found associated with A. ovis (32.3% of co-infections). Sequence analysis of the gltA and 16S rRNA genes confirmed the species identification of all detected Anaplasma species. A probably new Anaplasma species was detected for the first time in Corsica using the 16S rRNA nPCR. Furthermore, we found several circulating A. phagocytophilum genetic variants. Sequence analysis of A. ovis 16S rRNA revealed a single SNP that delineates two sequence groups (Ao1goat and Ao2sheep), which were significantly linked to the host of origin. Additionally, two groups of A. bovis gltA sequences were identified (Ab1 and Ab2, with 87.4% sequence homology), forming two novel clades. While the Ab1 clade is closely related to the six previously described clades, the Ab2 clade formed a separate phylogenetic group that also contained isolates from Corsican symptomatic goats. In conclusion, Anaplasma species are highly prevalent in the small ruminant population of Corsica, confronted with a great diversity of co-infecting species and genetic variants."

To do so, we fine-tuned ESM2-8m using databases curated for biogeochemical cycling pathways. Our resultant BioGeochemical cycling transFormer (BioGeoFormer or BGF) was high-performing on validation and test sets, producing embeddings that exhibit an ability to infer protein function at a metabolic pathway level. BGF was applied to a dataset of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) constructed from methane-fueled, deep-sea, \"cold seep\" environments to demonstrate its utility in contrast to current informatics approaches. We employed multiple gene assignments to identify gene function within these MAGs. A total of 1.05M genes were assigned biogeochemical functions, with BGF alone suggesting putative ecosystem roles for 0.49M (46%) of these at a confidence of 85% or greater; these genes were classified as unknown by the other approaches. Across the pathways of interest, BGF identified 6 times as many genes, on average, as Hidden Markov models (HMMs) as well as alignment based approaches across the various pathways. BGF provides a novel tool that is capable of informing process-based hypotheses in diverse systems, highlighting cryptic proteins most notably linked to methane, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling while uncovering the mysteries within microbial dark matter."

Subsequent research has revealed the methanotrophic metabolism of Crenothrix bacteria and their disproportionately high activity in stratified lakes compared to unicellular strains, yet laboratory cultivation has proven elusive, leaving the ecophysiology of Crenothrix bacteria largely unknown. Here we report the isolation of two methanotroph strains of the \"lacustrine Crenothrix\" clade from an iron-rich wetland and reveal their highly unique cell biologies and potential ecological roles. Using physiological approaches, we demonstrate that the strains perform a microaerobic methane metabolism while growing distinct filaments having wide and directionally oriented connective structures. The strains further have broad genomic repertoires for addressing redox stress that we show are uniquely associated with lacustrine Crenothrix compared to related methanotrophs based on genome data. Aligning with laboratory observations, we identify lacustrine Crenothrix bacteria along potential redox gradients in the wetland at iron-rich snow sites, and we further detect such bacteria in diverse global ecosystems based on public metagenome searches. Together, our data strongly point to an ecophysiology of lacustrine Crenothrix bacteria that is tightly linked to redox stress, and we propose these bacteria may uniquely store or share metabolic intermediates via their filamentous lifestyle to thrive under such conditions. Our results provide a fresh view of the diversity, evolution, and ecology of aerobic methanotrophs, connecting over 150 years of microbiology research opening vast new opportunities to probe bacterial adaptations that drive global methane cycling under redox stress."

Harnessing the potential of this waste material to support the synthesis of valuable products such as hydrogen fuel or reduced graphene oxide, which may be utilized for conductive thin films and energy storage2,3, can reduce waste and add revenue streams for dairy farmers. Here, we demonstrate a circular bioeconomy using alginate-encapsulated co-cultures of Shewanella oneidensis together with lactic-acid-producing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae. These co-cultures can directly metabolize unprocessed cheese-making waste as an electron source instead of costly, environmentally high-impact lactic acid4,5. Alginate-encapsulated co-cultures fed unprocessed dairy waste showed a 2-to-3-fold higher graphene oxide reduction rate compared to S. oneidensis monocultures with no supplemental electron source. Encapsulated co-cultures were able to be recycled for more than 30 days with no measurable decrease in graphene oxide reduction efficiency, showing compatibility with future industrial scaling. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation with cadmium selenide quantum dots as the catalyst resulted in 6-fold increases in hydrogen produced by co-cultures using milk as an electron source precursor for the system in comparison to S. oneidensis monocultures without any added electron sources. Thus, dairy waste may be processed to drive the synthesis of valuable products utilizing microbial electron transfer processes, converting a significant fluvial environmental pollutant into a valuable renewable energy resource that could provide a robust alternative revenue stream for dairy farmers in a volatile industry."

However, how spatial partitioning governs Hog1 pathway specificity remains poorly understood. Here, we generated genetically engineered strains expressing localization-restricted Hog1 variants including membranetethered and constitutively nuclear, and we compared their phenotypic traits with those of a fully functional Hog1mCherry strain. The membrane-tethered Hog1 restored thermotolerance and antifungal resistance in the hog1 mutant, whereas nuclear Hog1 was necessary for osmotic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and for capsule and melanin biosynthesis. These localization-specific effects were corroborated by the expression profiles of genes involved in glycerol biosynthesis, under osmotic stress or fludioxonil treatment. Measurement of intracellular glycerol revealed that the plasma membrane-tethering of Hog1 caused excessive accumulation, underscoring the importance of spatiotemporal regulation of Hog1 activity Also, nuclear Hog1 uniquely reinstated osmoadaptation and conferred tunicamycin tolerance independent of canonical Ire1Hxl1 splicing, suggesting a nucleus-centric module for ER stress protection. Conversely, membrane-tethered Hog1 enhanced glycerol accumulation and restored amphotericin B resistance while increasing azole susceptibility despite normal ergosterol levels, implicating localization-biased regulation upstream of sterol abundance. In the developmental program, membrane-tethered Hog1 dominantly suppressed the Cpk1-mediated mating. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Hog1 compartmentalization is a key determinant of stress adaptation, antifungal resistance, differentiation, and virulence regulation in C. neoformans."

    "content": "Abstract: Background and Aims The plant microbiome is considered as an extended part of the plant genome, and it provides key functions in regulating plant fitness, and stress tolerance. Plants and associated microbiomes have co-evolved over millennia, yet evidence for a strong influence of plant phylogeny in influencing their microbiomes is largely lacking. Our main aims was to identify key drivers of plant microbiome assembly. Methods Here, we conducted a full factorial experiment that included three levels of soil microbial diversity, five plant species from three functional groups (C3, C4, and C3 nitrogen-fixing), and two moisture availability levels. Results Our results showed that host identity and plant functional group exerted the strongest effect on leaf microbial assembly, while root and soil microbiomes showed less sensitivity to host selection. The initial soil microbial diversity and community structure significantly impacted soil and root microbial composition, but not leaf microbiomes. Importantly, we observed significant positive linkage between host phylogeny distance and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index in leaf microbiomes. This finding was further validated through analysis of microbiome data from seven plant species grown across different field and environmental conditions. Interestingly, there was no significant impact of short-term water stress on plant microbial communities. Conclusions By providing empirical evidence for important role of host selection in shaping plant microbiomes, this study advances our fundamental knowledge of plant-microbe interactions and their co-evolutionary relationships, and enhances our ability to develop future tools harnessing plant microbiome to improve plant health and productivity."

    "content": "Mycobacterium abscessus exhibits intrinsic resistance to conventional antibiotics, significantly limiting treatment options. Our previous studies established that MAB_2362 (SteA) is a key regulator of cell division that contributes to intrinsic resistance and virulence. Considering that SteA-like proteins often act alongside SteB counterparts, we hypothesized that the adjacent gene MAB_2363 encodes the corresponding SteB-like division regulator. In this study, we found that deletion of MAB_2363 significantly increased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics and disrupted cell wall permeability. Microscopy revealed striking cell division defects in the mutant, including elongated cell morphology and multiple septa. Subcellular localization of a GFP-MAB_2363 fusion protein demonstrated its enrichment at division septa, confirming its direct involvement in cell division. Deletion of MAB_2363 resulted in attenuated virulence, as evidenced by reduced bacterial survival in macrophages and murine infection models. To assess its functional relation with MAB_2362, we compared the single-deletion mutant of MAB_2363 with the single-deletion mutant of MAB_2362 and the double-deletion mutant of MAB_2362-MAB_2363. Notably, the phenotypes of the MAB_2363 mutant, including cell division defects, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence, were markedly milder than those of the other two mutants. Collectively, these findings indicate that MAB_2363 functions as a secondary but essential division-associated factor that operates during cell division, thereby influencing intrinsic resistance and virulence in M. abscessus."

Recently, an unexpected diversity in the composition of these complexes across unicellular eukaryotic lineages, with the apicomplexan parasites featuring prominently, has been revealed. However, whether the observed enlarged and divergent mitochondrial complexes are conserved across the wider Myzozoan lineage has not been investigated. Here, using a complexome profiling proteomic approach, we have characterised the composition of the mitochondrial complexes of the myzozoan parasite of oysters, Perkinsus marinus. We show that it shares with Plasmodium and Toxoplasma huge ATP synthase and mETC complexes. Moreover, the Perkinsus mitoribosome possesses many of the divergent features recently discovered in apicomplexans, such as an expanded subunit repertoire and the inclusion of RAP-domain and ApiAP2-like proteins as ribosomal proteins. Our study reveals the divergent subunit composition of mitochondrial complexes is an ancestral and highly conserved feature of Myzozoa."

    "content": "Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is maintained in an enzootic cycle between reservoir host birds and Culex (Cx.) spp. mosquitoes. This relationship presents a potential target for vector control strategies. Ivermectin (IVM), an endectocidal drug that selectively affects invertebrates while remaining safe at high concentrations in mammals and birds, can be delivered to Cx. tarsalis via blood meals from birds fed IVM-treated bird feed. In this study we evaluated the safety, efficacy, and utility of IVM-treated bird feed as a novel vector control strategy by assessing its impact on multiple bird species and mosquitoes. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected during peak WNV transmission season in Northern Colorado and DNA extracted from blood meals to determine host species. Chickens, pigeons, zebra finches, and house sparrows were fed different formulations of IVM-treated bird feed and observed for clinical signs, and their sera were fed to Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes to evaluate mosquitocidal efficacy. Feeding rates and IVM serum concentrations in birds were analyzed by unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA, and mosquito survivorship was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using paired log-rank tests. IVM serum concentration and mosquito survivorship were compared using Spearman correlation. Results: Speciation analyses conducted on blood meals from Cx. tarsalis collected during peak WNV transmission season in Northern Colorado determined that they feed primarily on songbird species that commonly visit bird feeders, with house sparrows representing the most frequent blood meal host. In laboratory experiments using multiple formulations and doses of IVM, chickens, pigeons, zebra finches, and house sparrows ate comparable amounts of IVM-treated bird feed compared to untreated feed, had similar weight gain, and exhibited no clinical signs of toxicity. Both colony-reared and locally captured Cx. tarsalis showed significant mortality after feeding on sera from IVM-treated birds compared to controls. Conclusions: These results suggest that targeting songbirds with IVM-treated bird feed should be safe for wildlife and may elicit high rates of IVM-induced mortality by reaching a large proportion of WNV vector mosquitoes via their proclivity for feeding on passerine birds."

    "content": "Oxygen concentrations fluctuate in soil across time and space. Under anoxic conditions, the three main microbial metabolic pathways - denitrification, fermentation, and DNRA - compete for the same carbon (C) sources. Studies on denitrification in complex soil communities often rely on incubation experiments to determine how various factors affect the regulatory biology of denitrifying organisms and their N2O emissions. These experiments typically require an exogenous C source to stimulate measurable activity, and the choice of C source is critical as it should support denitrification while minimizing competition from fermentation and DNRA. This consideration is equally important for the enrichment and isolation of diverse denitrifying organisms and for bioaugmentation-based N2O-mitigation strategies. Here, we compared twelve C sources, including glutamic acid, acetate, an artificial root exudate cocktail (eight compounds, individually and in combination), and a clover extract. By combining high-resolution denitrification gas kinetics, metagenomic sequencing, and 15N isotope labelling, we aimed to find a C source(s) that (1) supports a diverse soil-derived denitrifying community and (2) limits the competition for C from alternative anaerobic pathways. Among the tested substrates, only the clover extract supported denitrification and maintained a complex denitrifying community. Yet, it also promoted fermentation and DNRA, revealing that a trade-off must exist between fostering denitrifier diversity and limiting growth of organisms using competing anaerobic pathways. More broadly, our results highlight that C source is a methodological fulcrum in controlled soil microbiome studies. It shapes community composition, drives metabolic processes, and ultimately determines the ecological relevance of experimental outcomes and the success of enrichments and soil bioaugmentation approaches."

    "content": "Vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic marine pathogen that causes severe wound-associated and systemic infections. Following entry into the host, the bacterium must rapidly adapt to host-associated stresses that differ substantially from those encountered in aquatic environments. However, the physiological functions supporting bacterial fitness during infection remain incompletely understood. Previously, we applied signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) to identify genes required for V. vulnificus survival during host infection, revealing numerous loci that did not correspond to classical toxin-encoding genes. In the present study, we extended this genome-wide screen by linking STM-identified mutations to observable fitness-related phenotypes. Functional annotation revealed enrichment of genes associated with chemotaxis, flagellar motility, regulation, metabolism, and poorly characterized functions. Phenotypic analyses showed that many STM-derived mutants exhibited defects in swimming motility and altered colony surface properties. Bioluminescence imaging further revealed distinct patterns of impaired persistence and dissemination within host tissues, while several mutants displayed increased susceptibility to phagocytic stress in an HL-60-derived neutrophil model. Notably, some regulatory mutants affecting global signaling pathways exhibited impaired tissue dissemination despite retaining resistance to phagocytic stress, indicating the presence of fitness determinants that operate independently of classical surface-associated or cytotoxic traits. Together, these findings demonstrate that V. vulnificus fitness during infection depends on diverse physiological pathways beyond classical virulence factors, highlighting the value of phenotype-centered analyses for understanding bacterial adaptation in host-associated environments."

    "content": "The standard pharmacodynamic marker in murine tuberculosis drug studies is colony forming units (CFU). A faster PCR-based marker of bacterial burden is 16S rRNA. For unclear reasons, treatment reduces CFU more than 16S rRNA. We evaluated this CFU-16S gap and estimated the fraction potentially attributable to slow decay of 16S rRNA from dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) versus transition to a viable but not culturable on solid agar (VBNCSA) population. We quantified the CFU-16S gap during and following treatment in six BALB/c mouse studies and one in vitro study. Applying a two-population ordinary differential equation-based model of Mtb death and 16S rRNA decay, we estimated the fraction of the gap potentially attributable to dead Mtb. Using meta-regression, we estimated the association between CFU or 16S rRNA with relapse. For all regimens, CFU fell more than 16S rRNA, ranging from isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol (CFU decreased 39-times more than 16S rRNA at week 4) to bedaquiline-pretomanid-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide (CFU decreased >500,000-times more). The two-population model suggested that the fraction of the CFU-16S gap attributable to residual 16S rRNA from dead Mtb is modest and decreases over time. After treatment, 16S rRNA often fell while CFU rose. Four-week CFU change explained most variation in relapse (R2=0.90) while four-week 16S rRNA change did not (R2=0.24). CFU-16S gap is only partially explained by slow decay of residual 16S, suggesting development of a VBNCSA population. However, continued decrease in 16S rRNA after treatment cessation and its limited association with relapse suggests VBNCSA may be a transient rather than persistent state."

They arise without genetic change and can resume growth once the stress is removed and nutrients are available. Critically, upon resuscitation, persister cells can reconstitute infections. Although it is known that persister cells resuscitate in proportion to their ribosome content, it has remained unclear whether ribosome levels also influence the formation of persister cells. Here, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to fractionate exponentially growing cells into four populations spanning low to high ribosome levels and demonstrated that cells with low ribosome content form persister cells approximately 80-fold more frequently than cells with population-average ribosome levels. These findings show that persister cell formation is inversely proportional to ribosome abundance. Cells with low ribosome levels are less metabolically-active and therefore less capable of initiating a stress response like most cells; instead, they become dormant."

    "content": "Research into psychedelic compounds is in resurgence due to the exciting potential for their use in the treatment of psychiatric and mental health disorders. Despite this revival, remarkably little is known about their evolution. One of the most intriguing psychedelic compounds is psilocybin, the compound found in 'magic' mushrooms and used in ritual ceremonies in Central America for generations. Associated with agaricomycete fungi of the genus Psilocybe, psilocybin acts in a similar way to the neurotransmitter serotonin, yet how and why natural selection favoured its biosynthesis remains unclear. Given the resemblance to serotonin, modulation of invertebrate behaviour for defence is a likely explanation, but neither this nor alternative hypotheses have ever been formally tested. Here, we show that Drosophila larvae exposed to extracts from Psilocybe mushrooms exhibit reduced survival, pupation rates, and inhibited locomotion. Adults exposed during development show reduced thorax and wing size, along with increased fluctuating asymmetry, indicating developmental stress. Conversely, mutants lacking 5HT2A receptors showed the same response to Psilocybe extracts as wild-type flies. Furthermore, DNA metabarcoding revealed that while Psilocybe semilanceata demonstrates a distinct invertebrate community compared to most other grassland fungi, it overlapped with the non-psychedelic species Mycena epipterygia. This study provides a crucial first step toward understanding the evolutionary role of psilocybin-producing fungi and provides a grounding for future research into the molecular mechanisms, ecological interactions and evolutionary origins of psychedelic compounds in nature."

    "content": "Most arthropods are ectothermic, with multiple performance traits being constrained by environmental temperature. Through the effects on traits, temperature therefore constrains when, where, and how large are arthropod populations. Because many arthropods are of relevance to humans, for example as pests or disease vectors, biologists have spent substantial time trying to understand the mechanistic relationship between temperature and traits. For example, in mosquito and other vectors species, the lifespan of vectors - the number of days the adult survives -- is important in determining both the size of the vector population and whether or not vectors will likely be able to transmit pathogens. Often thermal traits such as lifetime are modeled using Thermal Performance Curves (TPC) -- functions that describe the relationship between temperature and traits mathematically. Many functional forms with many possible shapes have been proposed as TPCs. However, the effects of the distribution of data around these shapes and of common data transformations on how well we can infer the TCPs has been relatively ignored. In this paper we use simulated data on vector lifespans, inspired by mosquito data, to explore the reliability of inference under different assumptions about the data on our ability to accurately infer a known TPC. Using a Bayesian approach, we are also able to quantify the effects of data assumptions and transformations on uncertainty in estimates. Our results suggest that mismatches between a true and assumed distribution of data around a TPC can greatly increase uncertainty. Further, some transformations of the data before analysis are more likely to lead to biased results than others. Based on our results, we make suggestions for best practices in the analysis of arthropod thermal trait data such as lifespan and related traits."

    "content": "Although climate change has driven the widespread occurrence of species' range shifts, the ecological and evolutionary processes that generate these patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate spatial sorting and countergradient selection as evolutionary mechanisms contributing to range expansion. We focus on the rapid range expansion of a fiddler crab (Minuca pugnax) in the Gulf of Maine, an ocean warming hotspot. We use common garden experiments to quantify change in pelagic larval duration (PLD), a key determinant of dispersal ability, across edge and interior core populations, and between timepoints separated by 19 years. Consistent with spatial sorting, larvae from poleward, edge populations had shorter PLDs relative to equatorward, core populations, which is more dispersive in this system because it is characterized by equatorward flows. Compared to 19 years prior, PLDs were significantly shorter, consistent with genetic change over time. Analysis of sea surface temperatures reveal that the larval development window in the edge populations has doubled over the past twenty years, suggesting the combined influence of ocean warming, trait differentiation over time, and spatial sorting in promoting range expansion. While spatial sorting is known to aid in terrestrial range expansions, our results are the first to suggest that this process might be important in the coastal oceans."

    "content": "1. A central goal of biogeography is to partition the world's biota into meaningful biogeographical regions. While naturalists have long delineated biogeographic regions using hierarchical hard clustering approaches, they have often acknowledged the existence of transition zones. However, such transition zones have not been empirically identified or distinguished from hard clusters. Transition zones are outstanding areas for understanding the processes that shape biotic assembly; however, a coherent framework for delineating them is lacking. 2. Here, we propose a framework to empirically identify and analyze transition zones through a new metric, the \"Transition Zone Index (TZI)\". The TZI decomposes the proportional contribution of multiple biotas to a spatial unit (called a map cell) derived from a Grade of Membership model into a single quantitative measure per cell using Shannon entropy principles. The transition zones can then be quantified and presented as a gradient, scaled from TZI = 0 (indicating distinctive bioregions) to TZI = 1 (corresponding to the highly transitional areas with maximally admixed biotas). Finally, we implement spatial regression models to detect the predictors of these transition zones. 3. We demonstrate the application of our framework using vascular plants of southern Africa. Through the spatial variation of TZI, our approach represents transition zones as a continuous gradient of biotic turnover between bioregions. These transition zones were found to be either previously delineated as discrete clusters or incorporated into neighboring clusters. Our approach effectively captures both the intensity and width of transitional dynamics, showing that these patterns are primarily shaped by precipitation. 4. Biogeographic transition zones are a measurable gradient, and our framework provides a robust quantitative foundation for detecting and analyzing the drivers of these areas. This improves our ability to understand the patterns and processes underlying biogeographic transition and provides important implications for conservation planning and biodiversity management."

Here, we evaluate whether commonly observed biogeographical patterns apply to microbial biodiversity in pond fungal and bacterial communities. Specifically, we tested (1) whether these communities follow latitudinal diversity gradients and distance decay relationships, and (2) if variation in community composition or richness was related to specific environmental or land-use factors. [bullet] Location: Eastern, USA [bullet] Time period: Summer, 2022 [bullet] Taxa: Bacteria and Fungi [bullet] Methods: We collected water and muck from 39 ponds across 8 states in the Eastern USA. We extracted DNA from these samples and sequenced sections of the 16S rRNA and ITS1 genes to survey the bacterial and fungal communities, before evaluating biogeographical patterns. [bullet] Results: We found evidence of latitudinal diversity gradients in muck fungal communities, but not bacterial communities. We observed weak distance decay relationships in all sample types. Community richness was related to some environmental filters, where conductivity was positively related to water bacterial richness, but negatively related to muck fungal richness. Environmental drivers explained low to moderate variation in microbial composition, with temperature universally linked to microbial biodiversity. [bullet] Conclusions: Pond microbiomes exhibit unique biogeographic patterns depending on the microhabitat and microbial taxa in question, with land use and abiotic conditions, especially temperature, explaining some variation in microbial biodiversity across sites. Our findings suggest that the low spatial autocorrelation in environmental conditions and the lack of connectivity across ponds provides a useful framework for investigating localized drivers of microbial diversity."

    "content": "Aim The modern latitudinal diversity gradient of planktonic foraminifera is bimodal with a distinct depression near the equator, surrounded by mid-latitude diversity peaks. This pattern emerged after the Last Glacial Maximum, but it is unclear how species' spatial dynamics contributed to its formation. Here, we investigate how species range dynamics, i.e., trailing-edge contractions (extirpations) and leading-edge expansions (colonisations), shaped the modern bimodal pattern, and how global biodiversity patterns arise from local patterns. Location Global open ocean, with basin-specific analyses in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Time period Last Glacial Maximum (19 - 23 ka) (LGM) and the Pre-Industrial (modern) Major taxa studied Planktonic foraminifera (unicellular eukaryotes) Methods We analysed taxonomically standardized LGM and modern foraminiferal assemblage datasets to characterize changes in species richness at multiple spatial scales: global ocean, basin-wide, and within basin. We quantified species' range shifts by comparing their trailing- and leading-edge movements. We estimated temporal turnover locally, and the net imbalance between colonisations and extirpations (NICE) within sites, and tested whether species' thermal preferences correlate with their extirpation risk. Results We found no evidence of systematic trailing edge contractions, indicating that equatorial extirpations did not drive the bimodal LDG pattern. In the Atlantic, leading-edge expansions generated a coherent increase in species richness in the mid-latitudes, whereas the Pacific exhibited highly spatially heterogeneous responses, including extirpation hotspots in the western tropical Pacific and colonisation zones in the eastern and southern Pacific. Species' thermal optima weakly predicted extirpations, with species adapted to lower temperatures more at risk of extirpation, consistent with the general warming trend since the last ice age. Main conclusions The modern bimodal LDG of planktonic foraminifera arises primarily from mid-latitude colonisations rather than equatorial extirpations. Colonisations were particularly frequent in the North Atlantic. Localized extirpations in the western Pacific highlight small-scale patches of vulnerability, that spatially aggregated richness metrics mask. Our results underscore the need to distinguish between trailing and leading processes in climate-induced range shifts, and to consider spatial variability in monitoring and protection of marine biodiversity."

Pesticide residues were extracted using an adapted QuEChERS method and analyzed by LC-MS/MS, while inorganic elements were measured by ICP-MS and ICP-AES. Our results show that land-use and seasonal changes shape contaminant patterns in bees. Vineyards left the strongest chemical footprint on bees, as indicated by the wide diversity of contaminants detected in this environment. This reflects multiple exposure to both current and historical pesticide inputs -such as copper- which can accumulate over time to potentially harmful levels. Pollinators like honey bees provide effective indicators of environmental risk, as their health and contaminant loads can reveal broader ecological impacts.

These locations are characterized by differences in body size and experience distinct hydrographic conditions, including salinity, oxygen and temperature. We used 16s rRNA gene metabarcoding to compare skin microbiota diversity and composition in these populations. We found significant differences between the populations in both alpha and beta diversity, with higher microbial diversity observed in the Aland cod characterized by larger body size. Moreover, we identified a greater number of significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) metabolic pathways in Aland cod as compared to those from the Bornholm Basin, with many pathways absent in Bornholm. However, other GOs, such as those associated with the nervous system, were uniquely detected in the Bornholm cod. Differences in microbial communities can be influenced by external environmental factors, determined by the habitats where individual cod reside. These results indicate a potential relationship between the skin microbiome and host health; however, direct evidence for a causal impact remains limited, highlighting the importance of incorporating host skin microbiota interactions in studies of aquatic populations."

    "content": "Conventional tillage (i.e. plowing) is often associated with soil degradation and a loss of biodiversity. In response, reduced tillage has increasingly been promoted as a sustainable alternative for its positive impacts on soil structure, water dynamics, and biodiversity. However, reduced tillage not only favors beneficial soil-dwelling organisms, but also pests. In this field study, we examined the effects of five years of reduced tillage on the physical properties of the soil and the dynamics of Agriotes wireworm populations (Elateridae), which are increasingly widespread pests. Our results show that tillage reduction led to stable edaphic conditions and a redistribution of organic matter, creating a favorable environment for wireworms. While our results demonstrate the beneficial effects of reduced tillage on aggregate stability, they also indicate a concomitant increase in soil bulk density, suggesting a reduction in water-holding capacity. Monitoring of wireworm populations revealed their aggregated distribution and their increase in abundance in infested areas year on year. Monitoring soil moisture revealed that tillage reduction improved water dynamics, enhancing infiltration and reducing evaporation. This could potentially favor the development of wireworms. Surprisingly, wireworm size distribution showed a higher proportion of young instars in plowed plots, evidencing that, firstly, the lack of soil cover does not prevent oviposition and that injury caused by plowing targets more the last instars rather than young larvae. While reduced tillage improves key soil health indicators, our findings suggest a potential trade-off in terms of increased pest pressure. Our study highlights the importance of adopting a holistic approach when designing sustainable cropping systems, as well as considering the services and dis-services they provide."

    "content": "Little is known about the natural history of most Caenorhabditis nematodes, despite their importance as a model system in biology. While these nematodes rely on invertebrate hosts to disperse to new habitats, host use for most species has not been characterized. We surveyed the invertebrate community of a habitat containing three sympatric Caenorhabditis in southwestern Germany, determining differential and specific host use for each of these co-occurring species. We documented a specific association between C. sp. 8 and two species of invasive nitidulid beetles, and a particularly strong association of the nematode with the beetle Stelidota geminata, where we recovered more nematodes per individual beetle and a higher proportion of beetles carrying nematodes for S. geminata than for the co-occurring Epuraea ocularis. Our results provide evidence for group dispersal using beetles in C. sp. 8, supporting previous observations of collective dispersal behavior in this species, and establish a starting point for further dissecting the evolutionary and mechanistic causes and consequences of interactions between Caenorhabditis nematodes and their host species in ecologically relevant conditions."

    "content": "1. Climate change poses extreme risks to biodiversity, threatening the ecosystems upon which humanity depends. Understanding the traits that mediate how organisms respond to climatic gradients in space and time will enable better predictions of the taxa and ecological communities most at risk from warming. 2. In insects, colouration influences thermoregulation, but warming responses must be traded off against other selective pressures. We hypothesise that butterfly wing reflectance in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra respond differently to temperature and ultraviolet radiation over space and time. We combined existing reflectance data of 97 butterfly species in both NIR and visible wavelengths, with long-term abundance monitoring data of 120 butterfly communities sampled across 1650 m altitude gradients from May to August in two time periods (2004/5 and 2017). 3. The visible and NIR reflectances of butterfly communities showed a non-linear relationship with altitude, with the lowest reflectance (darkest butterflies) at the coolest, highest sites. In contrast, community visible reflectance decreased through the year as temperatures warmed over spring-summer, whereas community NIR reflectance remained constant, revealing divergent responses of reflectance types to seasonal changes. Temperature had opposing effects on visible and NIR reflectance of butterfly communities, where increasing temperature reduced community visible reflectance strongly while increasing community NIR reflectance slightly. 4. Considering the effects on reflectance of shared evolutionary history in a Bayesian hierarchical model for individual species, lighter-coloured (more reflective) species were associated with warmer temperatures - flying later in spring-summer or at lower altitudes. However, instead of decreasing in reflectance through the year and across temperature gradients, species instead became lighter, we expect as a result of a Simpson's paradox. 5. These results emphasise how visible and NIR reflectance wavelength bands mediate butterflies' responses to environmental gradients in distinct ways, despite being highly correlated across species. We also show that incorporating phylogeny into trait-environment models is essential; relying on traits alone would lead to incorrect inferences and predictions of taxa most at risk from warming climates."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe biological carbon pump (BCP) plays a critical role in sequestering atmospheric CO2 into the deep ocean; however, the influence of fine\u2010scale oceanic processes, encompassing mesoscale and submesoscale features, on basin\u2010scale carbon export remains poorly understood. Using a high\u2010resolution physical\u2010biogeochemical model and Biogeochemical\u2010Argo (BGC\u2010Argo) observations in the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) region of the Northwest Pacific, we demonstrate that fine\u2010scale processes significantly modulate carbon export through seasonally varying impacts on nutrient supply and phytoplankton growth. BGC\u2010Argo observations reveal that cyclonic eddies enhance and anticyclonic eddies suppress particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations and inventories through isopycnal displacement, providing critical evidence for the localized role of eddy dynamics and an observational foundation for exploring the basin\u2010scale impacts of fine\u2010scale processes. Compared to lower\u2010resolution simulations, high\u2010resolution models reveal that baroclinic instabilities enhance nutrient supply and phytoplankton growth in summer and autumn, increasing POC export by 42.4%. In contrast, frontogenesis\u2010induced downwelling reduces nutrients and phytoplankton growth in winter and spring, reducing export by up to 35.8%. Over a full annual cycle, these opposing effects result in a modest net basin\u2010scale enhancement of 2.6%\u20135.0% from fine\u2010scale resolution. These results reveal a seasonally opposing role of fine\u2010scale processes in regulating carbon export through biological pathways, demonstrating that resolving mesoscale\u2010to\u2010submesoscale dynamics across complete seasonal cycles is essential for accurately quantifying the ocean's biological carbon pump."

    "content": "Abstract\nSediments characterized by unsteady dynamics, such as mobile muds (MM), are commonly found in large\u2010river delta\u2010front estuaries (LDEs). These sediments undergo frequent resuspension and intense diagenetic processes. However, the extent and ecological significance of nutrient regeneration in these sediments remain poorly understood. Here, we measured porewater nutrients, total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in sediments of the East China Sea Mobile\u2010muds (ECSMM) and the adjacent shelf. An unsteady\u2010state model was developed to simulate the nutrient regeneration under high intensity of reworking. For unsteady stations, promoted benthic nutrient fluxes were \u22120.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16, 1.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04, 0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, and 1.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58\u00a0mmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121 for NO3\u2212 NH4+, PO43\u2212, and Si(OH)4, respectively. On average, the DIN and Si(OH)4 fluxes of unsteady stations are approximately 3 times those at steady stations, while PO43\u2212 fluxes could reach 8 times. These results revealed that ECSMM is an important nutrient source, and regenerated nutrients could sustain >10% of the local primary production. Furthermore, rapid nutrient regeneration in other major LDEs is estimated through published data. The highest fluxes are found in the Amazon Estuary with the thickest unsteady layer and the most intense reworking. Our work underscores the critical role of unsteady sediment deposition dynamics in global ocean nutrient biogeochemical cycles."

    "content": "Abstract\nTyphoons drive sedimentary dynamics and material transport in marginal seas, forming storm deposits that preserve critical information about these extreme disturbance. However, distinguishing typhoon\u2010induced provenance signals from hydrodynamic\u2010driven signals within sedimentary archives remains a major challenge. Taking the northeastern Beibu Gulf, influenced by Typhoon Yagi (2024), as the study area, we systematically collected post\u2010typhoon surface (storm\u2010layer) and subsurface (background\u2010layer) sediments. Grain\u2010size analysis, organic\u2010carbon parameters, and lipid biomarkers were integrated with satellite remote\u2010sensing and environmental data to test the tracing potential of lipid biomarker in storm deposits combining the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Results show that Typhoon Yagi emplaced a storm deposit with finer grain\u2010size (74.9% silt), elevated total organic carbon (0.90% vs. 0.30%), and richer lipid biomarkers. Marine biomarkers (brassicasterol, dinosterol, and C37 alkenones) indicate a concurrent phytoplankton bloom triggered by typhoon. Source\u2010specific terrestrial biomarkers reveal that typhoon\u2010driven terrestrial inputs dominate the nearshore zone with high n\u2010C29+31+33 alkanes, n\u2010C26+28+30 FAs, and n\u2010C28+30+32 alkanols, whereas distant\u2010source material, likely derived from the Red and Pearl Rivers, entered prominently along the eastern and western margins. EOF analysis reveals hydrodynamic reworking as an important controlling factor for storm deposit. Thus, typhoon\u2010induced storm deposits preserve a distinct signal of these dynamic reworking processes. This study provides the first systematic validation of source\u2010specific lipid biomarkers as sensitive tracers in storm deposits. Their anomalous concentrations, compositional signatures, and spatial patterns effectively discriminate between typhoon\u2010induced provenance and hydrodynamic transport processes, offering a novel proxy framework and theoretical basis for identifying modern storm deposits and reconstructing paleo\u2010typhoon activity."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nHeterogeneous mountainous environments and climate fluctuations during glacial periods can accelerate speciation and adaptive evolution in mountainous species. However, the interplay between these processes and their collective impact on mountainous diversity remains poorly understood, particularly across broad geographic scales. We conducted a comparative genomic study of Prunellidae (accentors), an avian family distributed across Eurasian mountain chains. Our analyses revealed low genetic divergence among species (DXY ranging from 0.631\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122 to 2.665\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122). When separated by elevation, high\u2010elevation species (>\u20092500\u2009m) exhibited greater genetic diversity than mid\u2010 (1000\u20132500\u2009m) and low\u2010elevation species (< 1000\u2009m). Demographic reconstructions showed distinct response to Last Glacial Maximum: high\u2010elevation species experienced population declines, mid\u2010elevation species maintained stable population sizes, while low\u2010elevation species underwent expansions. High\u2010elevation species also showed signatures of divergent selection in genes involved in blood vessel development and DNA break repair, suggesting adaptation to extreme environments. Despite these differences, we detected widespread interspecific introgression, with the most pronounced event occurring between low\u2010elevation P. montanella and the ancestor of high/mid\u2010elevation species. The introgressed regions showed evidence of positive selection and reduced genetic load, potentially facilitating P. montanella's recent expansion into higher elevations. Our findings demonstrate how elevational segregation drives montane diversity and underscore the importance of adaptive introgression in the evolution of the montane species."

Adaptation of soil microbial functionality to environmental conditions across space and time has consequences for biogeochemical fluxes that are often not explicitly considered in models describing soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. Eco\u2010evolutionary optimization (EEO) tries to anticipate the outcome of eco\u2010evolutionary dynamics, and can inform on how microbial functional traits might adapt to environmental conditions based on the maximisation of different proxies of microbial fitness. While different approaches employ different fitness proxies, they all aim to increase realism and generality by grounding SOM models in eco\u2010evolutionary theory and introducing constraints on model parametrization. Despite this potential, challenges for widely applying EEO approaches to advance SOM models persist and open questions remain, primarily concerning implicit assumptions, convergence of predictions, and empirical validation of the different EEO approaches. In this Synthesis, we review EEO approaches that have been applied to SOM models and provide an instructive primer to EEO approaches. We then propose a general categorization, aiming to make their underlying assumptions explicit and give an outlook for future research directions."

We examined an eclogite\u2010garnet peridotite interface from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Program in the Sulu orogen, representing the slab\u2013mantle wedge boundary formed during continental subduction. Whole\u2010rock magnesium (Mg) isotopic and major\u2010trace element data, together with in situ mineral analyses, identify the presence of carbonic fluids characterized by notably light Mg isotopic compositions (\u22120.54 to \u22120.36\u2030) and elevated Ca, Mg, Sr, and rare earth elements contents. These fluids, generated by slab decarbonation during prograde metamorphism, mobilized carbon from the subducted crust and enriched the mantle wedge. Modeling indicates that continental subduction rivals oceanic systems in transporting carbon to mantle. However, the paucity of mantle\u2010derived magmatism limits carbon return, promoting long\u2010term retention of continental carbon in mantle and establishing continental subduction as a major sink in the global carbon budget."

Intense hiss emissions are frequently generated within dynamic plasmaspheric plumes through linear and nonlinear wave\u2010particle interactions.

In this study, we perform ray\u2010tracing simulations to investigate the global propagation of plume hiss under varying plume morphologies, including different widths and levels of density lumpiness. We find that most hiss power is confined near the local time sector of the plume. Narrower plumes with embedded density ducts significantly enhance earthward wave guidance into the plasmaspheric core, compared to wide, smooth plumes. Furthermore, a subset of rays guided azimuthally along the plasmapause can serve as seed waves for intense dayside hiss. Our results highlight the role of plume hiss in shaping the global\u2010scale distribution of hiss waves."

However, the influence of the crustal fields on shaping the Martian dayside magnetosphere remains ambiguous. To explore this, an entirely induced magnetosphere and a hybrid magnetosphere are obtained from a Hall\u2010magnetohydrodynamic model without and with the consideration of the crustal fields under average solar wind conditions. Simulation results reveal that the presence of the crustal fields typically enhances and twists magnetic field and associated current within the Martian hybrid magnetosphere. Accordingly, the crustal fields significantly augment the intensity of motional and Hall electric fields, from which ions tend to acquire considerably additional energy for escape. These findings provide valuable insights into the structuring of the Martian hybrid magnetosphere under the impact of the crustal fields."

Here we show that this is less likely to be driven by solar wind kinetic power than previously thought. We determine that the solar wind kinetic power at Uranus has been increasing since the start of solar cycle 24 in 2009, while Uranus's thermospheric temperature has continued to decline. A comparison of the ascending phases of solar cycles 24 and 25 shows an increase in solar wind power of 15%, while Uranus's thermospheric temperature decreased by 18% in the same timeframe. If the solar wind was a driver of thermospheric temperature at Uranus it would be expected that Uranus would have reversed its declining temperature trend in recent years. We have also estimated that a decline in energy sourced from the solar wind would not be sufficient to change the thermospheric temperature by the level observed."

In the process it shows that the limit of length scales not constrained by observation is a product of the system and not imposed through ensemble perturbations. Finally, it is shown the removal of length scales not constrained by observation through the use of the ensemble mean reduces error in surface currents relative to a single simulation."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche (RREA) is the primary mechanism for enhancing atmospheric electron and gamma\u2010ray fluxes when the electric field exceeds a density\u2010dependent threshold. Another, non\u2010threshold process\u2014Modification of the Electron Energy Spectrum (MOS)\u2014occurs when subcritical fields energize ambient electrons, shifting their spectrum to higher energies and increasing bremsstrahlung probability. MOS becomes dominant at high energies, where the RREA flux rapidly decreases, explaining the persistent detections of gamma rays above 50\u201360\u00a0MeV. We simulate gamma\u2010ray yield over a wide range of Atmospheric Electric Field (AEF) to delineate MOS and RREA regimes and quantify spectral evolution with field strength. Experimental data from two Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs) observed on 2 October 2024, are analyzed. By matching the exponential growth of measured count rates to modeled RREA yield, we derive the temporal evolution of the AEF during both TGEs, revealing the rate and magnitude of field strengthening that drive particle bursts and bridge the MOS\u2013RREA transition in natural thunderstorms."

    "content": "Abstract\nMulti\u2010Doppler analyses from the joint Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign in the Pacific 2022 and Taiwan\u2010Area Heavy rain Observation and Prediction Experiment field campaign are used to examine the relationships between dynamics and rainfall intensity in two Mei\u2010Yu frontal periods. Statistics from oceanic rainfall over 8\u00a0days show a mean increase and a positive shift of the distributions of vertical vorticity, vertical motion, and divergence with increasing rain rate intensity. In regions of higher rain rates, mean ascent maximizes in the upper troposphere, low\u2010level convergence intensifies over a deeper layer, and upper\u2010level divergence strengthens. Stratiform rainfall is frequent in light rain rates below 5\u00a0mm\u00a0h\u22121 ${\\mathrm{h}}^{-1}$ but contributes little to the total rainfall. Heavy convective rain rates between 10 and 50\u00a0mm\u00a0h\u22121 ${\\mathrm{h}}^{-1}$ are only 6% of the observed raining grid points over the ocean but contribute over 45% of the total volumetric rainfall. The radar analysis indicates that the highest rain accumulations in the oceanic Mei\u2010Yu precipitation preferentially occur in moderately strong rotating convection."

    "content": "Abstract\nInduced seismicity is an inevitable consequence of subsurface resource development. Public concerns have been raised in cases where a surge in felt or damaging earthquakes has occurred because of industrial activity. The effective mitigation of induced earthquakes remains a major challenge despite the employment of several strategies. Here, we demonstrate that introducing shear thickening fluid into fault zones could effectively stabilize fault slip and inhibit earthquakes due to the fluid's rate\u2010dependent viscosity. In rotary\u2010shear friction experiments, the gouge\u2010fluid mixtures result in more stable slip than pure gouge samples, which exhibit stick\u2010slip motion under the same conditions. Additionally, the critical slip distance increases exponentially with increasing velocities, challenging the prevailing view that it is velocity\u2010independent. Since longer critical slip distances tend to promote fault stability, our results suggest that shear thickening fluid could delay or dampen the earthquake nucleation process as slip velocity increases, by directly modifying fault frictional properties."

The values span three orders of magnitude, with the greatest variability in metamorphic and surface rocks that host both highly reduced (rich in carbon and sulfur) and oxidized materials. In contrast, exhumed lower\u2010crustal and mantle rocks display more uniform values of dO2. This distribution reflects not a progressive net planetary oxidation, but active redox partitioning, shaped by far\u2010from\u2010equilibrium biological chemistry, surface processes, and tectonic cycling. Unlike thermodynamic potentials such as \u03bcO2, the compositional variable dO2 directly constrains the redox structure of Earth's shallow lithospheric reservoirs. This framework provides an experimentally grounded and physically intuitive metric for quantifying redox transfers and assessing their geophysical consequences."

    "content": "Abstract\nLagoons are recognized as significant CO2 sources in the global carbon cycle. However, the lack of comprehensive measurements capturing simultaneous spatiotemporal variations in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) limits our understanding of mechanisms driving CO2 dynamics in lagoons. In this study, autonomous buoys were deployed at five stations across Chiku Lagoon (Taiwan) during the wet season, continuously measuring temperature, salinity, and pCO2 for over 24\u2009h. Discrete water samples of total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon were collected to establish a freshwater\u2010to\u2010seawater mixing model. Our analysis revealed that biological activity accounted for most of the pCO2 variability (59%), followed by mixing processes (36%) and the temperature variations effect (5%). These effects contributed to spatial heterogeneity, with the upper lagoon exhibiting stronger emissions (4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u2009mmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009h\u22121; mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) than the middle and lower lagoon (0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 to 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009mmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009h\u22121). Meanwhile, tidal influences on CO2 fluxes were evident, with emissions at low tide (1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009mmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009h\u22121) nearly double those at high tide (0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009mmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009h\u22121). On average, all stations acted as net sources of atmospheric CO2 over the sampling period (1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009mmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009h\u22121). A resampling sensitivity test of the high\u2010resolution buoy data suggests a 3\u2010h interval is optimal in biologically and tidally driven lagoons such as Chiku. These results provide a framework for understanding spatiotemporal CO2 dynamics and serve as a guide for future monitoring and carbon management strategies in coastal environments."

In China's marginal seas, DOM levels are affected by coastal productivity and terrestrial inputs, yet the molecular mechanisms driving the DOM to RDOM transformation remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms behind the DOM transformation mediated by marine microorganisms in the Bohai and Yellow Seas, particularly focusing on molecular\u2010level characterizations of microbial carbon cycling processes. Here, using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the bacterial communities across the surface and deep layers. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT\u2010ICR MS) was used to molecularly characterize the DOM. Our findings revealed distinct bacterial diversity and functional profiles between the surface and deep layers, with deep layers exhibiting higher microbial diversity. Furthermore, the deep layers were characterized by higher proportions of RDOM, with molecular indicators such as carboxyl\u2010rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) suggesting enhanced carbon stability. This study highlights the role of microbial processes in shaping the molecular characteristics of DOM across depths, supporting the microbial carbon pump (MCP) framework and characterizing the Bohai and Yellow Seas as significant carbon sinks in the coastal region. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of oceanic carbon sequestration, particularly in coastal marginal seas."

This combinatorial approach enabled systematic interrogation of gene-environment interactions that govern neuronal metabolic adaptation. We identified genes--including genes associated with Leigh syndrome and autism spectrum disorder--whose importance for cell survival is highly sensitive to environmental context, revealing potential mechanisms underlying metabolic specification and selective neuronal vulnerability in neurological disorders. Our screens also uncovered regulators of neuronal glycolysis, including KIAA1429 and MAPT among others, which are previously uncharacterized modulators of neuronal glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility.

    "content": "Cancer cell adaptation to their physical tumor microenvironment is a key driver of malignancy. Recent experimental evolution experiments show that the soft extracellular matrix (ECM) can impose a selection pressure on genetically variable tumor populations. Over months of sustained culture, the selection pressure leads to enrichment of specific genetic variants with high fitness, but the mechanisms underlying the high fitness of these soft-selected clones are not fully understood. Here, we used a combination of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and RRBS-seq to compare soft-selected populations with non-selected ancestral populations cultured on soft ECM. We demonstrate that ancestral populations grown on soft ECM for short durations are characterized by a stressed cell state with low fitness marked by cell cycle arrest and distinct metabolic shifts, whereas sustained culture selects for a robust proliferative phenotype. Mechanistically, selected cells exhibit a silenced ancestral stress response through epigenetic modifications, characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility and de novo DNA methylation, including CDH1 promoter hypermethylation. This repressive landscape supports a high-fitness state defined by elevated MYBL2 and FAK levels. An in-silico mechanism-based model shows that these molecular differences, together with high YAP1 nuclear localization in soft-selected cells, are salient features of genetic clones capable of FAK upregulation. These findings uncover a coordinated genetic and epigenetic mechanism driving cancer cell evolution in mechanically soft microenvironments."

    "content": "Comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of Boolean models of biological systems is hampered by the exponentially large state space. Here we introduce the succession-diagram-based Markov chain (SD Markov chain), a coarse-grained representation that uses trap spaces (unescapable state subspaces) of the Boolean model as the states of a Markov chain. These trap spaces and their succession diagram can be efficiently identified, and constitute a dramatic reduction compared to the full state space. The SD Markov chain preserves the decisions that trap the system's dynamics while making the state space computationally tractable. Using an ensemble of random Boolean networks with known state transition matrices, we show that the SD Markov chain accurately reproduces attractors, basins of attraction, convergence probabilities, decision transitions, and sequences of events. By combining the interpretability of the succession diagram with the probabilistic rigor of Markov analysis, the SD Markov chain offers a compact quantitative description of the attractor landscape and provides a new avenue for studying control and stability in complex biological systems."

    "content": "The ultimate promise of single cell \"RNA velocity\" methods is compelling: in principle, one can project forward the transcriptional state of each cell and map long-term expression trajectories. While there has been robust and ongoing articulation of limitations of existing methods, consensus frameworks continue to overlook a fundamental aspect of cellular dynamics: growth. In a growing population, biomass (including RNA and other macromolecules) is constantly accumulating. This implies a homeostatic velocity (defined in the terms of production and degradation) that is positive, which is at odds with the conventional estimation, interpretation, and uses of velocity. Here, we investigate the consequences of omitting cell growth from the RNA velocity framework. We demonstrate systematic errors that arise from ignoring cell growth and show evidence for these artifacts in existing data. Finally, we point the way forward and highlight that explicitly accounting for cell growth can lead to new biological insights."

    "content": "The combination of direct-acting and host-directed antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents an attractive treatment strategy to combat COVID-19. In our previous work, we showed that the FDA-approved anti-arthritis drug Auranofin restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathology in an animal model. Here, we report that Auranofin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by targeting viral entry and main protease (Mpro) activity without affecting viral transcription. Time-of-addition studies combined with functional assays of viral entry, protease activity, and cell-cell fusion delineated its inhibitory effects at both early and late stages of the viral life cycle. Molecular docking and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses of Auranofin and the known Mpro inhibitor Nirmatrelvir indicated competitive binding within the Mpro active-site pocket. In addition, Auranofin attenuated NFkB-dependent signaling and suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production. Combination studies with SARS-CoV-2 targeting nucleoside analogues revealed the strongest synergistic antiviral activity with remdesivir in vitro. Comparable synergy was observed between auranofin and GS-621763, the orally bioavailable derivative of remdesivir, and was further validated in a preclinical animal model. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale for the further development of auranofin-nucleoside analogue combinations targeting SARS-CoV-2."

    "content": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is maintained clonally in a wide array of tumors and cells of lymphoproliferative disorders, yet the degree to which these infected cells continuously depend on EBV remains unresolved. To directly assess EBV dependence, we used two complementary Cas9-based viral eviction strategies: 1) targeting EBNA1 to promote episome dilution during cell division, and 2) targeting repetitive viral genomic regions to rapidly degrade EBV episomes. Using these approaches, we evaluated EBV-loss sensitivity across newly-derived, phenotypically diverse EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma lines. We also evaluated cell lines from patients with EBV-associated T/NK and epithelial malignancies. We included the Burkitt Lymphoma cell line, Akata-GFP, as our EBV-loss-tolerant control and a lymphoblastoid cell line as our EBV-loss-sensitive control. We observed EBV-loss sensitivity in all the EBV-positive Burkitt Lymphoma cell lines and the chronic active EBV disease cell line. In contrast, the EBV-positive gastric adenocarcinoma lines were markedly less sensitive to EBV loss. EBV latency type did not predict EBV dependence, indicating that viral gene expression programs alone do not dictate reliance on the virus. These findings demonstrate that EBV dependence is prevalent across multiple EBV-associated disease models and is especially pronounced in early-state or newly derived lymphoid malignancies."

    "content": "The therapeutic potential of phages is frequently compromised by rapid bacterial adaptation. Strategies such as phage cocktails and phage training are widely used to counteract bacterial resistance. Although phage receptor mutations are highly common, bacteria can also exploit flexible non-genetic strategies to evade phage recognition. Overcoming such phenotypic resistance remains particularly challenging due to its transient and reversible nature. Here, we investigated the coevolutionary dynamics between Klebsiella pneumoniae and a phage cocktail with complementary host tropisms: a capsule-dependent phage and an acapsular-targeting phage, coevolved with bacteria either individually or in combination. The coevolutionary phage training demonstrated that evolution of the acapsular-targeting phage was the main driver of the enhanced resistance delay observed. Notably, while bacteria could evade individual phages through non-mutational mechanisms, the combined selective pressure imposed by the phage cocktail constrained this reversible escape route, forcing bacteria to evolve mutation-based resistance mechanisms. Together, these findings highlight the importance of elucidating phage-bacteria coevolutionary dynamics to optimize phage-based therapeutics design and reshape bacterial evolutionary trajectories toward favourable outcomes."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.19.695452v1?rss=1",
    "content": "In the human host, the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans must adapts to niches that vary markedly in oxygen tension, ranging from the hypoxic gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts to more oxygen-rich niches such as the skin. Thriving across this spectrum requires the capacity to dynamically rewire core metabolic pathways in response to fluctuating oxygen levels. Yet, despite the central role of oxygen in shaping fungal metabolism and fitness, the genetic basis underlying hypoxic adaptation in C. albicans remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed a genetic screen to identify genes required for adaptation to hypoxia (5% O2). This comprehensive approach revealed numerous genes spanning diverse metabolic and stress-related functions that are essential for optimal growth under oxygen-limiting conditions. Notably, this study uncovers a previously unrecognized role for the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling pathway and the chromatin-remodeling complex Ino80 in orchestrating the fungal adaptive response to hypoxia. Integration of ino80 mutant transcriptomic data with Ino80 DNA-binding and nucleosome-occupancy profiles under conditional INO80 depletion revealed that this chromatin remodeler regulates the cellular phosphate demand associated with hypoxic exposure. The similarity between chromatin accessibility changes following TOR1 and INO80 depletion further suggests that Ino80 acts in concert with the TOR pathway to support growth and maintain phosphate homeostasis under low-oxygen conditions. Collectively, these findings provide new insight into how nutrient and oxygen signaling converge on chromatin remodeling, offering a mechanistic framework for understanding the regulatory logic underlying hypoxic adaptation in pathogenic fungi."

    "content": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human gammaherpesvirus implicated in a wide spectrum of inflammatory and malignant diseases. Although EBV toggles between latent and lytic states, the host cues that control this switch remain incompletely defined. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A; hereafter IL-17), a signature Th17 cytokine, is abundant in EBV-associated tissues, and EBV products can augment IL-17 responses. Whether IL-17 directly modulates the EBV life cycle has remained unknown. Here we show that IL-17 alone is sufficient to induce EBV lytic reactivation in latently infected human B cells. Across RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and RNA-seq, IL-17 increased the immediate-early regulator BZLF1 (Zta) and upregulated downstream early and late viral genes, consistent with activation of a transcriptome-wide lytic program. Culture supernatants from IL-17-treated cells contained elevated DNase-resistant extracellular EBV DNA, indicating productive replication with encapsidated genomes. Transcriptomic pathway analyses confirmed engagement of IL-17-linked signaling and highlighted inflammatory modules, including NF-{kappa}B and JAK-STAT. Gene Ontology analysis further enriched for regulation of B-cell receptor signaling and B-cell activation, situating IL-17 within B-cell inflammatory circuitry. Together, these findings identify IL-17 as a cytokine cue for EBV lytic entry and provide a mechanistic link between Th17-skewed inflammation and episodic EBV reactivation. This cytokine-driven pathway complements existing models centered on B-cell receptor signaling, hypoxia/HIF-1, COX-2/PGE2, and TGF-{beta} and motivates testing whether modulation of the IL-17/IL-17R axis can alter EBV reactivation in IL-17-rich settings. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that IL-17 alone directly triggers EBV lytic reactivation in human cells."

This study systematically investigated the genetic determinants and metabolic mechanisms of skatole degradation in the environmentally versatile Gram-positive genus Rhodococcus. We demonstrated that skatole degradation was a broadly conserved trait across diverse Rhodococcus species, including R. aetherivorans, R. pyridinivorans, R. ruber and R. qingshengii. Genomic and functional analyses uncovered a novel flavoprotein monooxygenase (FPMO) SkaA as the initial catalyst for skatole catabolism. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli confirmed SkaA's essential catalytic role, with high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identifying the key product 3-methyloxindole and 3-hydroxy-3-methyloxindole. Distribution studies revealed SkaA homologs predominantly in Actinobacteria, particularly Nocardia and Rhodococcus, indicating conserved metabolic capacity for skatole transformation within this phylum. Notably, Rhodococcus strains lacking the skaA gene also retained skatole degradation activity, implying the existence of alternative genetic determinants. Crucially, phylogenetic analysis positioned SkaA as a distinct subclass within Group E FPMOs, exhibiting [&le;]40% sequence identity to reported styrene/indole oxygenases. The phylogenetic segregation of skatole, indole, and styrene monooxygenases provides a predictive framework for functional annotation of Group E FPMOs. Our findings elucidate a novel skatole transformation pathway, establish Rhodococcus as environmentally versatile biocatalysts, and provide new insights into the study of Group E FPMOs."

The continuous emergence of variants of concern has necessitated the development of platforms that can be rapidly adapted. Nanobodies offer advantages over conventional monoclonal antibodies, including low molecular weight, high antigen-binding affinity, enhanced tissue penetration, blood brain barrier permeability, and simplified production. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nanobodies against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus in animal models. We previously reported the protective effects of nanobody trimers against SARS-CoV-2. However, pharmacokinetic and biodistribution data for nanobodies remain limited. To address this, we evaluated the efficacy, biodistribution and longevity of action of a nanobody trimer (A8) administered intranasally (IN) or intraperitoneally (IP) in Syrian golden hamsters. Our findings revealed that the A8 trimer reached peak concentrations shortly after administration and was subsequently cleared from the system via both routes. Importantly, early administration of A8 trimer reduced virus-mediated weight loss and viral load compared with untreated controls, supporting its potential as a therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Host range testing against a small library of S. aureus isolates from patients with bacteremia and periprosthetic joint infections showed lytic activity against >60% of tested strains. Evaluation of phage-resistant mutant derivatives of the cognate host showed disruptive mutations within tarS, a gene responsible for modifying wall teichoic acid. tarS products have been proposed as a target of other members of Roundtreeviridae. Synergy testing in MRSA demonstrated phage-antibiotic synergy between M963 and vancomycin, tetracycline, and methicillin. The M963-methicillin synergy prompted testing of the phage-resistant mutant derivatives, showing that phage resistance led to a transient methicillin-susceptible phenotype at clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentrations in some mutants.

    "content": "Tree plantations are expanding worldwide, negatively affecting native bird communities. However, most research has focused on the impact of tree monocultures on bird taxonomic diversity, while studies on their effects on functional and phylogenetic diversities are limited. This study aimed to compare different bird diversity facets between Eucalypt monocultures and mixed tree plantations, as well as the impact of proximity to urban areas. Bird surveys were conducted during spring using point counts in central Argentina. The mixed tree plantations consisted of Cedrus deodara, Eucalyptus globulus, Ligustrum lucidum, Pinus taeda, and Celtis australis, with more understorey cover compared to Eucalypt monocultures. Although bird species richness and Simpson diversity were similar between tree plantations, mixed plantations exhibited higher Shannon diversity. Functional and phylogenetic diversities were comparable across plantation types but were significantly influenced by the distance to urban areas. Functional diversity decreased near urban areas, while phylogenetic diversity showed the opposite pattern. The results showed that the increased habitat heterogeneity of mixed plantations likely supported more diverse bird communities, including a greater number of species typical of native woodlands in central Argentina. Additionally, the landscape context significantly influenced the bird communities in tree plantations."

Effective and efficient methods that allow for broad-scale sampling of nectar volume and sugar concentration across a diversity of taxa are needed to improve our understanding of many dimensions of mutualistic plant-pollinator interactions--including their basic ecology and evolution, their responses to environmental change, and their conservation and restoration. 2. Despite the key importance of nectar for mediating plant-pollinator interactions, quantifying floral nectar in the field from many different plant species is challenging because there is often no one-size-fits-all sampling method that is effective across a diversity of floral structures and nectar traits. Different methods require different preparation, and sampling from many species involves a variety of logistical challenges. 3. Here we provide a methodological roadmap for sampling floral nectar in the field from many different plant species. We describe our nectar collection methods in detail, including necessary equipment, calculations, and approaches appropriate for different floral morphologies. We also provide a troubleshooting guide for common problems encountered while collecting nectar in the field. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our methods for collecting nectar from many different species, we present results on nectar trait variation from 53 species in an ecosystem. 4. Our method illustrates that nectar traits vary considerably within and among plant species, indicating that large-scale nectar sampling projects are an important consideration for many basic and applied questions in pollination ecology and evolution. We hope that across many plant communities and ecosystems, our paper provides a practical roadmap for how to navigate the complexities of quantifying floral nectar traits."

    "content": "Resource availability is crucial in shaping exposure and resistance to parasites. Although effects are expected to vary across parasite species, most of our knowledge comes from single-host, single-parasite studies. In a wild wood mouse population (Apodemus sylvaticus), we supplemented dietary resources over 3 years and quantified effects on a diverse parasite community alongside host behaviour and physiology. Resource supplementation had diverse impacts on 12 parasite taxa including positive (3/12), negative (6/12), and null (3/12) results. Supplementation also influenced host biology, with supplemented mice moving less, experiencing higher conspecific densities, improved conditions, and increased reproduction. These findings experimentally demonstrate that resource availability can multifacetedly affect disease dynamics. The complexity likely arises due to combined effects on exposure and susceptibility processes. Our study advances understanding of disease drivers at the human-wild interface and underscores the importance of assessing whole parasite communities to predict responses to changing resource landscapes in the wild."

    "content": "Detecting patterns in animal social behaviour and movement is complicated by the diversity of ecological, evolutionary, environmental, and biological drivers of these behaviours such as migration, foraging, assortative mixing,socio-ecological factors, and human influence. Addressing these complexities requires a multidisciplinary approach. Recent advances in network analysis and machine learning offer powerful tools for examining and interpreting complex network structures, aiding in the identification and quantification of movement patterns and the prediction of behavioural changes. Here we use a comparative approach leveraging network analysis and machine learning techniques to assess commonalities in standard theoretical social structures governing networks across the animal kingdom. We investigate how these theoretical structures explain social organization at different scales, from entire populations to smaller groups. By leveraging interpretable machine learning techniques, we examine the predictive power of species and network construction techniques in predicting structural features of animal social networks. We found that geometric graphs are the frequently predicted network model across the animal kingdom. These graphs represent both spatial and social processes and are formed by positioning individuals uniformly on a 2D plane, with links established based on proximity within a specified distance. In particular, geometric graphs demonstrate structural similarities with interaction types and data collection methods. For example, we found that this graph model had strong structural similarities with networks derived from physical contact and spatial proximity data. Networks with small-world properties, in contrast, were rare across all interaction types and collection methods. Additionally, the occurrence of these networks is influenced by the identity of species and sampling duration. Although incorporating species identity into the classification model did not improve the accuracy of the prediction, it enabled us to account for the varying dependencies of biological characteristics on specific behaviours. This study highlights the value of predictive modelling for uncovering ecological drivers of animal network structures. By focusing on standard theoretical models that are well established in network science, we connect animal social networks to broader theoretical findings, while recognizing that more tailored models combining multiple generative models or network properties may offer deeper insights into network structures. We also emphasize the importance of considering how the specific methods used to build networks for each taxon could influence the biological inferences that can be drawn from those networks."

    "content": "Monitoring and managing the public health risk posed by marine biotoxins is a daunting challenge. With expansive coastlines, 1000s of seafood species, and dozens of biotoxins, monitoring cannot occur everywhere at once. Improving the cost-effectiveness of biotoxin monitoring is thus critical to expanding coverage to include more species, toxins, and locations. Notably, understanding the rate at which seafood species depurate biotoxins can be used to optimize the cadence of monitoring. We conducted a systematic review to collate marine biotoxin depuration rates and synthesize the factors that influence them; identify knowledge gaps, best practices, and research priorities; and generate predictions of depuration rates for unstudied species. We found that only 85 marine species have been studied for their biotoxin depuration rates. Depuration rates for non-bivalves and for toxins besides paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are especially understudied. Depuration half-lives varied from 0.03 to 1269 days based on species, toxin, tissue, and environmental conditions. In general, depuration accelerates with increased temperature and food availability, with implications for aquaculture siting, depuration enhancement, and biotoxin monitoring. We identified unstudied bivalve and finfish species that are highly produced and vulnerable to HABs that are high priorities for future research. Finally, we used a Bayesian regression model to predict PST depuration rates for 102 unstudied bivalve species, the only clade-syndrome with sufficient training data. These predictions can guide efficient monitoring and management until lab- or field-based depuration rates become available. We recommend that future studies directly estimate depuration rates to ensure their comparability across studies and utility to managers."

    "content": "Background: Gastrointestinal parasitic (GIP) infections can decrease the survival and reproductive performance of humans and livestock. Even so, the immediate and delayed fitness consequences of GIP in unmanaged wild mammal populations, particularly during the sensitive and energetically demanding early life stage, remain largely unknown. Methods: We investigate non-invasively the effects of GIP during early life on the survival to adulthood, age at first reproduction and longevity of 68 individually known female spotted hyenas in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We also test whether a high investment in gastrointestinal local immunity (i.e. faecal mucin and immunoglobulin A) and an elevated allostatic load (i.e. faecal glucocorticoid metabolites) decrease these measures of performance, when controlling for resource availability and maternal effects (i.e. maternal social rank) using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Ancylostoma sp. infections and the level of immunoglobulin A both negatively associate with survival to adulthood, probably because of the damage caused by the parasite and resource allocation trade-off between immunity and maintenance. Conversely, maternal social rank has a positive influence on survival to adulthood and longevity. Immune responses, allostatic load and GIP do not affect the age at first reproduction, suggesting either no effect, a complex interaction between different life stages, or a more immediate time-dependent effect. Conclusion: Our study highlights the critical role of GIP infections and maternal effects on early-life fitness and long-term outcomes in females of a wild carnivore, thereby contributing to our understanding of ecological dynamics in unmanaged ecosystems."

The so-called subcluster 5.2 represents a particularly diversified subgroup, including marine and freshwater organisms adapted to extreme conditions, notably polar environments. We increased the genomic representation of polar taxa in this subcluster by reconstructing new high-quality genomes from five Antarctic lacustrine strains and one Arctic freshwater isolate using a combination of small Illumina and long Nanopore reads. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenomic analysis of these new assemblies combined with all publicly available good quality assemblies of the subcluster 5.2 suggests evidence of a dispersal process from Antarctica. Indeed, the topology of the phylogenomic tree indicates one basal Antarctic lineage followed by the emergence of two lineages, one Antarctic and one non-Antarctic (Spain). This finding is further supported by a 16S rRNA ML phylogenetic and a pangenomic analysis. Although secondary colonization of Antarctica by cyanobacteria following the cooling of the continent 34 million years ago has been reported, this study is the first to support an Out-of-Antarctica scenario inside subcluster 5.2."

    "content": "Predicting the species composition of microbial communities is a problem that has proven surprisingly difficult, including in fully controlled microbial systems in a lab setting. Few organisms are able to establish themselves in an community with no others, even if nutrients are provided. At the same time some species are observed to be unable to stably coexist with certain other species. We here present a model attempting to reduce the dynamics of community assembly to its most basic components, while preserving its salient features. The model deals not with abundances or densities of bacterial populations or resources, but only with their presence or absence. Similarly, only three types of discrete relationships between species are considered: species excluding each other, and mutualistic dependence on and production of nutrients in the form of exometabolites. Despite these simplifications, the model system still exhibits rich dynamics, including extinction cascades and emerging stability against invasion. We derive conditions for these to occur and compare our results with existing knowledge of microbial communities. Our results provide a novel approach for the theoretical study of microbial communities and their stability."

    "content": "Abstract\nDespite the widely recognized importance of wetland CH4 emissions as a climate change feedback, simultaneous measurements of CH4 transport pathways and oxidation in a wetland are rare. Thus, these critical components of many CH4 models are poorly parameterized because of the lack of appropriate data. We measured plant CH4 transport and diffusion on two sampling dates in a Minnesota, USA, bog where a whole\u2010ecosystem manipulation experiment of temperature and atmospheric CO2 (SPRUCE) is occurring. We also used stable\u2010isotope methods to estimate CH4 oxidation rates. Plant CH4 transport was high in graminoids and, especially, the forb Maianthemum trifolium early in the growing season, while CH4 emissions from the trees Picea mariana and Larix laricina were minimal. Diffusive transport and CH4 oxidation rates were uniformly low. A prior study found low rates of episodic, large bubble CH4 ebullition in this bog. Despite large variation in plant and whole\u2010plot CH4 emissions, a substantial fraction of whole\u2010plot CH4 emissions could not be accounted for using a mass balance approach, which may be attributable to microbubble release from peat, although this requires further investigation. We compare our measured rates to two CH4 models that have been developed and tested at SPRUCE, both of which overestimate plant and diffusive CH4 transport in S1 Bog relative to our results. We emphasize the importance of enabling CH4 models to incorporate plant\u2010mediated CH4 transport that is species\u2010dependent and allowing plant species to dynamically change in response to climate change."

Quantifying aquatic emissions at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for understanding their biophysical drivers, constraining the global carbon budget, and improving climate projections. Current floating chamber techniques rely on labor\u2010intensive manual sampling or expensive infrared greenhouse gas analyzers, which limit the spatial and temporal sampling frequency. Here, we present an improved, inexpensive autonomous floating chamber design: AQUA\u2010Flux (autochamber for quantifying and understanding aquatic fluxes), which can capture diffusive and ebullitive methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes on small freshwater bodies at high frequency. A solar\u2010power system enables long\u2010term deployment. We have successfully tested 12 AQUA\u2010Flux systems for up to six months in two environmental extremes\u2014the Arctic tundra and Brazilian Amazon. Low\u2010cost sensors measure CH4 and CO2 concentrations within a closed chamber, and a linear actuator extends and retracts to vent the chamber headspace between flux measurements. Field\u2010based calibrations using an infrared gas analyzer indicate that these low\u2010cost sensors perform well, with average resolutions of 2\u20133\u00a0ppm for both CH4 and CO2. We also show that sensors can be field\u2010calibrated using discrete samples collected manually for laboratory analysis (gas chromatography), providing a lower\u2010cost calibration method. The AQUA\u2010Flux is well\u2010suited for water bodies with high fluxes. We include detailed assembly instructions to enable others to create and improve the design. By developing inexpensive open\u2010source tools, we aim to democratize greenhouse gas flux measurements and ultimately improve global estimates of fluxes from aquatic environments."

Results reveal that the glacial air\u2010sea cooling contrast is negatively related to the magnitude of sea surface cooling, consistent with a simple moist static energy theory. This relationship can be used to constrain S, further suggesting a median LGM surface cooling of \u22125.6\u00b0C.

In this study, we present the global distribution of whistler mode waves in the magnetosheath and their dependence on solar wind parameters, based on 7\u00a0years of data from three Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) probes. Our findings reveal that whistler mode waves in magnetosheath peak near noon, spanning from 9 to 15 magnetic local times, with amplitudes reaching up to 100 pT. Furthermore, whistler mode wave amplitudes and occurrence rates are slightly larger on the dawnside than duskside. Additionally, whistler mode wave amplitudes tend to increase with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure and cone angle. These results provide valuable insights into the plasma and wave environment right upstream of Earth's magnetopause under various solar wind conditions."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) is the dominant climate pattern that affects heatwaves and droughts across Europe and downstream over Asia. However, its seasonal prediction remains challenging. While recent studies have identified stratospheric pathways for improving SNAO prediction, the role of tropospheric wave dynamics remains unclear. Using a latest\u2010generation large\u2010ensemble seasonal forecasting system, we find that the model exhibits limited SNAO prediction skill and underestimates downstream climate impacts. These limitations are associated with deficiencies in circumglobal waveguide dynamics. Subsampling ensemble members that best capture circulation anomalies near circumglobal teleconnection centers or tropical/monsoon rainfall that forces the teleconnection is accompanied by significantly improved SNAO prediction. Furthermore, deficiencies in the model circumglobal waveguide, particularly over the Mediterranean and North Atlantic with underestimated background zonal winds and erroneous curvature, may disrupt wave propagation. Refining these dynamical features could improve teleconnection representation and SNAO prediction, aiding summer climate risk mitigation."

    "content": "Abstract\nMethyl chloroform (MCF) is an ozone\u2010depleting substance used as an industrial solvent. Its primary sink is oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH), making it a key tracer for estimating atmospheric oxidative capacity. Following Montreal Protocol regulations, MCF emissions declined rapidly after the 1990s. However, the recent atmospheric MCF decay suggests persistent emissions and/or declining OH (contradicting chemistry\u2010climate models projecting increasing or stable OH). The air\u2010sea exchange of MCF has been poorly constrained due to limited observations and simplified ocean representations. We simulate oceanic MCF fluxes using a modern ocean reanalysis and validate with depth\u2010resolved observations. Results suggest the ocean has shifted from a net sink to a net source around 2005, outgassing 0.5\u00a0Gg\u00a0yr\u22121 in the 2010s (up to 30% of inferred MCF emissions). This ocean outgassing is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates, and accounts for up to a third of the model\u2010observation discrepancy in OH."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Western Pacific Hadley Circulation (WPHC), the strongest regional Hadley circulation (HC), plays a crucial role in regional and global climate variability. Observations since 1979 reveal a pronounced strengthening of the boreal spring WPHC in the Northern Hemisphere, but the contributions of internal variability versus external forcing remain unclear. Using large ensemble simulations, we find that approximately 71% of the recent strengthening is attributed to phase transitions in three key sea surface temperature (SST) gradients\u2014tropical Western Pacific (TWP)\u2010Western North Pacific, TWP\u2010Tropical Eastern Pacific, and TWP\u2010Tropical Indian Ocean, indicating an internal variability mode linked to the inter\u2010basin SST gradient. Constraining future projections with skillful ensemble members based on these gradient phases reduces projection uncertainty by nearly 49% and suggests a likely weakening in coming decades. These results highlight the dominant role of internal variability and the importance of accurately representing tropical SST gradients for near\u2010term regional HC projections."

    "content": "Abstract\nThree solar energetic particle (SEP) events originating from solar active region 13664 occurred on 10\u201316 May 2024, coinciding with a geomagnetic superstorm. Using data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites and Meteorological Operational satellite\u2010C, we investigate the energetic proton fluxes and east\u2010west flux ratios in geostationary orbit, as well as the cutoff L $L$\u2010shells measured in low Earth orbit during these events. For the first time, we find the rigidity dependence of the correlations between the east\u2010west proton flux ratios and the Kp $Kp$ index, the Dst $Dst$ index, and solar wind dynamic pressure. The corresponding correlation coefficients significantly increase and then decrease with the increase of proton rigidity. Such non\u2010monotonic variation can be well explained by the penumbral rigidity cutoffs of penetrating protons in west\u2010looking and east\u2010looking directions. The results suggest the strong influence of geomagnetic shielding on SEP penetration."

Here, we leverage principles from yeast genetic networks to identify human gene modules enriched for genetic interactions. Using our Cas12a-based In4mer combinatorial knockout platform, we screen all pairwise interactions within receptor tyrosine kinase and DNA damage response modules across eight diverse cancer cell lines. We identify hundreds of unreported synthetic lethals, including a dense network within the protein glycosylation machinery, and confirm that interactions in 2D cell culture are maintained in more physiologically relevant models. Our targeted modules show up to 16-fold enrichment of interaction density, providing a scalable strategy for systematic interaction mapping."

    "content": "Phosphate is central to modern bioenergetics and to all theories for the origin of life. How and where phosphate entered metabolism are unknown, but microbial physiology and geochemical environments can provide important clues. Some bacteria obtain electrons and energy from phosphite (HPO32-), a reduced form of phosphate (HPO42-), that naturally occurs in serpentinizing (H2-producing) hydrothermal systems. Here we show that native palladium, which also occurs in serpentinizing hydrothermal systems, catalyzes the oxidation of phosphite to phosphate and H2 in water at 25-100 C in an exergonic reaction. Phosphite oxidation over Pd in water generates a reactive but yet unknown chemical intermediate, possibly metaphosphate, [PO3]-, that phosphorylates hydroxyl moieties in a wide spectrum of biologically relevant compounds including glycerol, ribose, glucose, serine and cytidine, forming phosphoester bonds at 25-100 C in 2-72 h. The same conditions also phosphorylate (i) phosphate residues, forming phosphoanhydride bonds in pyrophosphate, polyphosphates and ADP, (ii) creatine, forming the phosphoramidate bond in phosphocreatine, and (iii) acetate, forming acetyl phosphate. The reactions proceed without sulfur, excluding thioester or metal sulfide intermediates. Phosphite-dependent phosphorylations under conditions of serpentinization identify a natural, geochemical source of prebiotic phosphorylation and furthermore identify a source of continuous, aqueous metabolic energy that overcomes thermodynamic barriers at origins. This novel route of phosphorylation explains the centrality of phosphate in heredity and energetics as a chemical inheritance from the site where metabolism and life arose."

However, gaps in our understanding of phages and our inability to rapidly engineer them with new genetic cargo hinders progress towards phage-based therapies. To address the lack of unbiased, genome-wide mutational tools for phages, we developed transposon mutagenesis employing CRISPR-anti-CRISPR (Acr)-based selection and deep-sequencing (Phage Tn-seq). Transposon mutagenesis was effective for phages with unmodified or hypermodified genomes and a jumbo phage that protects its DNA within a nucleus. Phage Tn-seq enabled phage gene essentiality assignment consistent with structural proteomics and core gene conservation. Insertion biases allowed prediction of transcriptional direction and early injected phage DNA regions. We exploited the method to rapidly deliver new cargo to phage genomes in just a few days and used an AI-designed Acr to expand the phage transposon toolbox. Phage Tn-seq is a versatile tool to advance our understanding and applications of phages."
