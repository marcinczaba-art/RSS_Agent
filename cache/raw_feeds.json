Today, by contrast, most people live in countries that have already completed this transition, as fertility has fallen below replacement levels\u2014the number of children needed per woman (about two) to keep a population stable over time\u2014across much of the globe. As a result, migration and, to a lesser extent, longevity have become central to population change.

Seeking to help fill this knowledge gap, in our study we investigated the bacteriome of the insect (larvae and adult) and coffee leaves by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We found that at the phylum level Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota dominate. At the genus level, leaves were mainly dominated by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sphingomonas</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Methylobacterium</span>; the caterpillar were mainly dominated by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Xanthomonas</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Paracoccus</span>; the adult moth were mainly dominated by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Acinetobacter</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Klebsiella</span>. We estimate that the contribution to the bacteriome of adult moths comes from larvae, 50%, from leaves, 40%, and 10% from other sources. Several bacteria with the potential to degrade insecticides and secondary plant compounds were found, which leads to the expectation that they may help their hosts in resisting these toxic compounds.

An operon of five <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">mhq</span> genes in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Paenibacillus</span> sp.

The two most prominent species associated with humans, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Enterococcus faecalis</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Enterococcus faecium</span>, have also emerged as prominent opportunistic pathogens causing a range of infections in hospitalized patients, including urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. The rise of antibiotic resistance in enterococci undermines the efficacy of the treatment of infections, thus posing a significant public health risk. Enterococci readily acquire resistance to antibiotics through chromosomal mutations and the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance among enterococci, with an emphasis on resistance to last-line antibiotics, including to glycopeptide antibiotics like vancomycin and teicoplanin, oxazolidinones (primarily linezolid), and daptomycin. Furthermore, we evaluate relevant candidates in the current development pipeline for antibiotics and discuss alternative strategies (phage therapy and immunotherapeutics) for the treatment and prevention of infections with multidrug-resistant enterococci. As enterococci rapidly adapt to novel conditions, including by developing resistance to new drugs and therapies, sustained research efforts are required to ensure the continuous development of treatment options for these important opportunistic pathogens.</span>"

To enhance microbial tolerance, extensive synthetic biology strategies have been developed. The cell envelope serves as the primary natural barrier in microorganisms, and both its intrinsic composition, including membrane lipids, membrane proteins, and cell wall components, and the regulation of these components play crucial roles in modulating cellular responses to environmental stress. Engineering strategies targeting intracellular components, such as transcription factors and repair pathways, have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing microbial tolerance to toxic end-products and intermediates. Additionally, recent advances have focused on extracellular engineering, including biofilm formation and the modulation of intercellular interactions, which have garnered significant scientific interest.

The synthesis of CoA entails several conversions, starting from pantothenate. Pantothenate is an essential vitamin in humans and is synthesized by certain bacterial species. Intermediates of the biosynthetic pathway have been shown to impact bacteria, especially in community settings such as the intestinal microbiota. Additionally, various diseases have been associated with specific CoA precursors and metabolic pathways downstream of CoA in the gut microbiota, underscoring the significance of evaluating the current knowledge on how the CoA pathway influences the metabolic state of bacteria. This also highlights the importance of having standardized methodologies that can be employed to better understand the metabolism of the microbiome. In this review, we explore the current literature on bacterial CoA metabolism, with a particular focus on gut bacteria and the impact of CoA-related metabolites on bacterial composition, function and metabolism. Furthermore, we discuss previous and current methodologies employed to investigate CoA biosynthesis. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the intricate relationship between CoA metabolism, gut microbiota and their implications for health and disease, offering a foundation for future research and therapeutic approaches.</span>"

It allows hijacking the cellular pathways deputed to protein or nucleic acid homeostasis to degrade a target macromolecule of interest involved in a pathogenic process. In the last decades, targeted protein degradation has been widely applied for the treatment of cancer or neurodegenerative disorders and some of such therapies are already in clinical use. More recently, therapeutic degraders such as PROTACs, LYTACs, HyTs, BacPROTACs, and others have also been explored in the field of antimicrobial and antiviral drug discovery. The peculiar mechanism of action, along with the opportunity to degrade both microbial and host targets, holds great promise for overcoming some limitations of classic antimicrobials, e.g. drug resistance, as well as for increasing the potency of current therapies. With a focus on the antimicrobial field, this Review aims at providing a comprehensive, state-of-the-art description of targeted degradation mechanisms and strategies developed so far, as well as to discuss advantages, disadvantages, and caveats of this innovative approach for combating infectious diseases.</span>"

The early history of carbon metabolism is preserved in archaeal and bacterial enzymes for glucose synthesis and breakdown. Here, we summarize the distribution and phylogeny of enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism from genomes of cultured prokaryotes. The presence of glycolytic pathways in H<sub>2</sub>-dependent chemolithoautotrophs, including methanogens, which cannot grow on exogenous glucose, correlates with their use of glycogen for intracellular carbon storage. Glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis are universal among prokaryotes, but glycolysis is not, indicating that the enzymatic conversions of glycolysis arose in the gluconeogenic direction encompassing three phases: (1) an autotrophic origin from H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> to pyruvate and triosephosphate (trunk glycolysis) fulfilling basic amino acid and cofactor synthesis in the last universal common ancestor, (2) from triosephosphate to glucose supplying cell wall (murein and pseudomurein) and nucleic acid biosynthetic requirements in the first free-living autotrophs, also giving rise to intracellular carbon reserves (glycogen), followed by (3) diversification and transfer of enzymes for glycogen-mobilizing glycolytic routes. An autotrophic origin of trunk glycolysis followed by glycogen-dependent origin of glucose utilization account for conservation, distribution, and diversity of enzymes observed in microbial sugar phosphate pathways.</span>"

While the roles of latent or integrated viral genomes in cancer have been documented, emerging evidence highlights the contribution of defective viruses\u2014those carrying intragenic deletions or loss-of-function mutations\u2014in promoting viral oncogenesis. These altered genomes often lack genes essential for lytic replication or immune recognition, which enhances their persistence and immune evasion. In virus-associated diseases, specific patterns of gene retention and deletion suggest that host-driven selective pressures drive the emergence of these altered genomes.

Despite its limited host range and lack of zoonotic potential, ASF has severe socio-economic and environmental consequences. Current control strategies primarily rely on early detection and culling of infected animals, but these measures are insufficient given the rapid spread of the disease. Developing effective therapeutics against ASFV is crucial to prevent further spread and mitigate economic losses. Although vaccination remains critical, recent vaccine approvals in Vietnam have raised safety and efficacy concerns. Moreover, as challenges persist in vaccine development and deployment, particularly in complex field conditions, antiviral agents have emerged as a critical complementary approach. These agents have the potential to mitigate side effects and control viral spread when vaccines alone are insufficient or when animals face simultaneous exposure to vaccine strains and wild-type viruses. However, advancing them from proof-of-concept to widespread practical application entails a significant interdisciplinary effort, given the logistical and economic constraints of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in vivo</span> testing.

This review explores how environmental cues regulate PTMs at specific sites within distinct domains of H-NS, thereby modulating its oligomerization and DNA-binding capabilities to reprogram bacterial responses. Notably, HGT elements commonly encode counter-silencing factors, including PTM-modifying enzymes, that counteract H-NS repression. We propose that combinatorial PTM patterns on H-NS form the bacterial histone-like epigenetic code, regulating the expression of HGT elements. Collectively, these interactions establish a sophisticated network of silencing and counter-silencing mechanisms that drive bacterial genome evolution.</span>"

In response, host cells initiate a coordinated LDR, integrating membrane repair, selective autophagy, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de novo</span> biogenesis. This review delineates a systems-level model of lysosomal quality control governed by three critical regulatory axes: LGALS3/8/9, TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases, and the AMPK-TFEB signaling pathway. LGALSs detect exposed glycans on ruptured membranes, triggering ESCRT-mediated repair and recruiting ARs. TRIM proteins mediate context-specific ubiquitination, enhancing cargo selection and facilitating transcriptional reprogramming via TFEB. Simultaneously, AMPK-TFEB signaling links metabolic stress to lysosomal regeneration, reinforcing immune defense and cellular adaptation. We highlight emerging mechanisms, including ATG8ylation, CASM, Ca2\u00a0+\u00a0leakage, and SG formation, that refine this multilayered response. Mtb virulence factors selectively disrupt these pathways, revealing their relevance to pathogen persistence. Beyond infection, this triadic network maintains lysosomal integrity in neurodegeneration, inflammation, and lysosomal storage disorders. Understanding its modular design reveals novel therapeutic targets and HDTs for combatting drug-resistant TB. This review integrates recent advances into a coherent framework that redefines lysosomal function as a dynamic, immune-regulatory hub essential for cellular resilience under infectious and metabolic stress.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Host-mediated natural competence for transformation of DNA and mobile genetic element (MGE)-driven conjugation and transduction are key modes of horizontal gene transfer. While these mechanisms are traditionally believed to shape bacterial evolution by enabling the acquisition of new genetic traits, numerous studies have elucidated an antagonistic relationship between natural transformation and MGEs. A new role of natural transformation as a chromosome-curing mechanism has now been proposed. Experimental data, along with mathematical models, suggest that transformation can eliminate deleterious MGEs. Supporting this hypothesis, MGEs have been shown to use various mechanisms to decrease or block transformability, such as disrupting competence genes, regulating the development of competence, hindering DNA uptake machinery, producing DNases that target the exogenous (transforming) DNA, and causing lysis of competent cells. A few examples of synergistic relationships between natural transformation and MGEs have also been reported, with natural transformation facilitating MGE transfer and phages enhancing transformation by supplying extracellular DNA through lysis and promoting competence via kin discrimination. Given the complexity of the relationships between natural transformation and MGEs, the balance between antagonism and synergy likely depends on specific selection pressures in a given context. The evidence collected here indicates a continuous conflict over horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, with semiautonomous MGEs attempting to disrupt host-controlled DNA acquisition, while host competence mechanisms work to resist MGE interference.</span>"

However, there is currently a lack of synthesis of this expanding knowledge base of viruses with potential to cause another severe disease outbreak. This has led to many vaccine trials considering protection against a small subset of known betacoronaviruses that poorly approximate the true diversity of this group of viruses. This review aims to synthesize information gained from the recent surge in betacoronavirus characterization, providing a catalogue of viruses exhibiting features that pose a risk to public health, together with a framework for assessing their likelihood of emergence and subsequent transmission through human populations. This information will help inform global pandemic preparedness measures before a novel betacoronavirus outbreak occurs.</span>"

Excessive salt induces physiological drought and toxicity stress in plants, causing chlorosis, ion imbalances, and enzyme disruptions. This paper discusses microorganisms\u2019 resistance mechanisms, plant responses to salt stress, and summarizes current knowledge on bacterial osmoprotectants and their functions. It also reviews emerging agrobiotechnological strategies using microbial osmoprotectants to remediate salinized soils and enhance plant growth and productivity under salt stress. Osmoprotectants stabilize proteins, buffer redox potential, and retain water, thus alleviating osmotic stress and promoting bacteria and plants growth. Their application improves soil properties by enhancing aggregate formation, water permeability, moisture content, cation exchange capacity, and ion availability. Despite extensive literature on the function of osmoprotectants, the knowledge about their role in soil environments and agrobiotechnology applications remains limited. This paper indicates proposed research perspectives, including discovering new osmoprotectants, their correlation with soil fertilization, interactions with the soil microbiome, and plant responses. It also identifies significant knowledge gaps in these areas, highlighting the need for further studies to consolidate existing data and assess the potential of this approach to enhance soil health and crop productivity in saline environments.</span>"

In the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, hypoxia is among several environmental stresses that opportunistic pathogens must overcome to persist and chronically colonize. Although the role of hypoxia in the host has been widely reviewed, the impact of hypoxia on bacterial pathogens has not yet been studied extensively. This review considers the bacterial oxygen-sensing mechanisms in three species that effectively colonize the lungs of people with CF, namely <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia</span> complex, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mycobacterium abscessus</span> and draws parallels between their three proposed oxygen-sensing two-component systems: BfiSR, FixLJ, and DosRS, respectively. Moreover, each species expresses regulons that respond to hypoxia: Anr, Lxa, and DosR, and encode multiple proteins that share similar homologies and function. Many adaptations that these pathogens undergo during chronic infection, including antibiotic resistance, protease expression, or changes in motility, have parallels in the responses of the respective species to hypoxia. It is likely that exposure to hypoxia in their environmental habitats predispose these pathogens to colonization of hypoxic niches, arming them with mechanisms than enable their evasion of the immune system and establish chronic infections. Overcoming hypoxia presents a new target for therapeutic options against chronic lung infections.</span>"

This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diversity, biology, and ecological interactions of AGM, highlighting the intricate relationships with their fungal symbionts. The implications for adaptive radiation and speciation are critically considered, including how fungal associations may have facilitated ecological flexibility and diversification.

While extensively studied in animals and plants, the role of electrical signaling in fungi remains a largely underexplored field. Early studies suggested that filamentous fungi generate action potential-like signals and electrical currents at hyphal tips, yet their function in intracellular communication remained unclear. Renewed interest in fungal electrical activity has fueled developments such as the hypothesis that mycorrhizal networks facilitate electrical communication between plants and the emerging field of fungal-based electronic materials. Given their continuous plasma membrane, specialized septal pores, and insulating cell wall structures, filamentous fungi possess architectural features that could support electrical signaling over long distances. However, studying electrical phenomena in fungal networks presents unique challenges due to the microscopic dimensions of hyphae, the structural complexity of highly modular mycelial networks, and the limitations of traditional electrophysiological methods.

TA systems are considered as stress-responsive elements, consisting of both toxin and antitoxin genes, typically organized in operons or encoded on complementary DNA strands. A decrease in the antitoxin\u2013toxin ratio, often triggered by specific stress conditions, leads to toxin excess, disrupting essential cellular processes and inhibiting bacterial growth. These systems are categorized into eight types based on the nature of the antitoxin (RNA or protein) and the mode of action of toxin inhibition.

Elevated levels of these bile acids are thought to correlate with a perturbed gut microbiome, which cannot efficiently convert primary bile acids into secondary bile acids.

Thus, spores survive in the environment until taken up by a host where they encounter an environment suitable for germination and then proliferate in the largely anaerobic large intestine; some ultimately sporulate there, regenerating environmentally resistant spores in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">C. difficile</span> life cycle. This review summarizes current literature on the effects of bile acids and their metabolites on spore germination in the gut and evidence that adaptation to bile acids as germinants is a consequence of a life cycle both inside and outside the digestive tract.</span>"

However, direct plant extraction and petrochemical synthesis often struggle to meet current needs due to low yield or facing economic and environmental hurdles. In the past decades, systems metabolic engineering enabled eco-friendly production of various aromatic compounds, with some reaching industrial levels. In this review, we highlight monocyclic aromatic chemicals, which have relatively simple structures and are currently the primary focus of microbial synthesis research. We then discuss systems metabolic engineering at the enzyme, pathway, cellular, and bioprocess levels to improve the production of these chemicals. Finally, we overview the current limitations and potential resolution strategies, aiming to provide reference for future studies on the biosynthesis of aromatic products.</span>"

Microorganisms in these conditions are subjected to additional stress compared to their counterparts in moderate environments and in many cases have evolved unique adaptations, including the production of specialized MVOCs. This review highlights the diversity of MVOCs identified in extreme environments or produced by isolated extremophiles. Furthermore, we explore potential applications already investigated and discuss broader implications for biotechnology, environmental biology, and astrobiology.</span>"

To these ends, we illustrate the utility of studying bacteria-EcMF interactions, detail outstanding questions, outline research priorities in the field, and provide a suite of approaches that can be used to promote experimental reproducibility, field advancement, and collaboration. Though this review centers on the ecology of bacteria, EcMF, and trees, it by default offers experimental and conceptual insights that can be adapted to various subfields of microbiology and microbial ecology.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Pathogenic microorganisms can infect a variety of niches in the human body. During infection, these microbes can only persist if they adapt adequately to the dynamic host environment and the stresses imposed by the immune system. While viruses entirely rely on host cells to replicate, bacteria and fungi use their pathogenicity mechanisms for the acquisition of essential nutrients that lie under host restriction. An inappropriate deployment of pathogenicity mechanisms will alert host defence mechanisms that aim to eradicate the pathogen. Thus, these adaptations require tight regulation to guarantee nutritional access without eliciting strong immune activation. To work efficiently, the immune system relies on a complex signalling network, involving a myriad of immune mediators, some of which are quite directly associated with imminent danger for the pathogen. To manipulate the host immune system, viruses have evolved cytokine receptors and viral cytokines. However, among bacteria and fungi, selected pathogens have evolved the capacity to use these inflammatory response-specific signals to regulate their pathogenicity. In this review, we explore how bacterial and fungal pathogens can sense the immune system and use adaptive pathogenicity strategies to evade and escape host defence to ensure their persistence in the host.</span>"

This review explores the environments in which active microorganisms do not occur. Within the known niche space for life, uninhabited, but habitable physical spaces potentially offer opportunities for hypothesis testing, such as using them as negative control environments to investigate the influence of life on planetary processes. At the physico-chemical limits of life, questions such as whether spaces devoid of actively metabolizing or reproducing life constitute uninhabitable space or space containing vacant niches that could be occupied with appropriate adaptation are raised. We do not know the extent to which evolution has allowed life to occupy all niche space within its biochemical potential. The case of habitable extraterrestrial environments and the scientific and ethical questions that they raise is discussed.</span>"

This review discusses the existing methods used to study eight distinct aspects of cable bacteria research, including the challenges of culturing them in laboratory conditions, performing physical and biochemical extractions, and analysing the conductive mechanism. As cable bacteria research requires an interdisciplinary approach, methods from a range of fields are discussed, such as biogeochemistry, genomics, materials science, and electrochemistry. A critical analysis of the current state of each approach is presented, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of both commonly used and emerging methods.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>A key question in microbial ecology is how the microbiota regulates host invasion by pathogens. Several ecological theories link the diversity, abundance and assembly processes of the microbiota with its resistance to invasion, but the specific properties of microbial communities that confer protection to the host are poorly understood.We addressed this question for the oomycete <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Plasmopara viticola</span>, the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew. Using state-of-the-art microbial ecology methods, we compared microbial communities associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic leaf tissues to elucidate pathogen-microbiota interactions.Despite visible symptoms, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P. viticola</span> infection induced only subtle changes in microbial community composition. Symptomatic tissues showed enrichment in basidiomycete yeasts and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bacillus</span> species, both known for their biocontrol activity, and exhibited a higher degree of determinism in community assembly processes. Asymptomatic tissues hosted more diverse microbiota, but lacked consistent associations with known biocontrol agents. Instead, they were often associated with other airborne grapevine pathogens.These findings suggest a novel interaction scenario: upon infection, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P. viticola</span> reshapes locally the leaf microbiota, excluding other pathogens and selecting for beneficial microbes. Although further studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms, these findings underscore the relevance of targeting disease lesions in the search for protective microbial consortia.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Both deterministic (e.g. species\u2013environment interactions) and stochastic processes (e.g. random birth and death events) shape communities, but it remains poorly understood, which environmental conditions promote stochasticity. Here, we investigated interactive effects of nutrient availability and community size on stochasticity in order to predict how eutrophication and biomass loss shift the balance between predictable and random community dynamics. For this, we used freshwater bacterial communities in a microcosm experiment, where communities were diluted to varying sizes and exposed to low, intermediate, and high nutrient concentrations. Stochasticity was estimated with null modelling and as beta-diversity among replicate communities. At low nutrient concentrations, deterministic processes dominated, especially in smaller communities, which had the lowest diversity and abundance. Whereas, higher nutrient concentrations increased stochasticity. In contrast to theoretical predictions, this was particularly the case in larger communities with the highest diversity and abundance, likely due to stochastic initial growth. The findings underline how nutrient availability and community size jointly influence stochastic assembly processes, with important consequences for bacterial diversity and ecosystem functioning under environmental change.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Extreme rainfall and flooding are expected to increase in Northern subboreal habitats, altering soil hydrology and impacting greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes by shifting redox potential and microbial communities as soils transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. This study examined the effects of a 2-week growing-season flash flood on bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities and microbial processes driving CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes in riparian alder (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Alnus incana</span>) forests. Flooding reduced soil nitrate accumulation as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and promoted dinitrogen-fixing, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nifH</span> gene-carrying bacteria like <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Geomonas</span>. Sequencing data showed that anaerobic bacteria (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Oleiharenicola, Pelotalea</span>) increased during the flood, while N<sub>2</sub>O emissions declined, indicating a shift towards complete denitrification to N<sub>2</sub>. However, drier patches within the flooded area emitted N<sub>2</sub>O, suggesting nitrification or incomplete denitrification. A diverse arbuscular mycorrhizal community was detected, including genera <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Acaulospora, Archaeospora, Claroideoglomus, Diversispora</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Paraglomus</span>. Flooding increased the abundance of the fungal genera <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Naucoria, Russula</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tomentella</span> and the family <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thelephoraceae</span>, which symbiotically support alder trees in nitrogen uptake and carbon sequestration. Microtopographic differences of 0.3\u20130.7\u00a0m created spatial variability in GHG emissions during flooding, with some waterlogged areas emitting CH<sub>4</sub>, while others enhanced CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation (determined by FAPROTAX) and promoted nitrification-driven N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in drier, elevated zones. We conclude that flash flooding during the active growing season significantly affects nitrogen-fixing and nitrifying microbes and alters symbiotic fungal community composition, creating spatial variability in GHG emissions.</span>"

However, current workflows remain computationally demanding and challenging to operate without dedicated infrastructure and expertise. To overcome these limitations, we present BinderFlow, an open, structured, and parallelised pipeline that automates end-to-end protein binder design. Its batch-based architecture enables live monitoring of design campaigns, seamless coexistence with other GPU-intensive processes, and minimal user intervention. BinderFlow\u2019s modular design facilitates the integration of new tools, allowing rapid adaptation to emerging methods. We demonstrate its utility by running automated design campaigns that rapidly generate diverse, high-confidence candidates suitable for experimental validation. To complement the pipeline, we developed BFmonitor, a web-based dashboard for real-time campaign monitoring, design evaluation, and hit selection. Together, BinderFlow and BFmonitor make generative protein design more accessible, scalable, and reproducible, streamlining both exploratory and production-level research. The software is freely available at https://github.com/cryoEM-CNIO/BinderFlow under the GNU LGPL v3.0 license."

    "content": "<p>by Miriam B. Goodman</p>\n\nWhether hosted by colleges, universities, stand-alone research institutions, federal research labs, or private companies, immersive summer (6\u201312 weeks) research experiences build students\u2019 confidence in their scientific capabilities and help to refine their professional trajectories. Such internships are an important tool to introduce students to STEM careers and energize participants, each of whom realizes a powerful benefit. The student gains hands-on research experience, insight into the research process, and clarity regarding their educational and career aspirations. The bench mentor, typically an advanced graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, or staff scientist, acquires essential skills in training and mentoring while incorporating fresh perspectives from an inquisitive novice into their research project. The principal investigator (PI) promotes the professional development of the bench mentor, expands interest in STEM careers, while exploring a focused and compact research question. This set of <i>Ten Simple Rules</i> is a guide for PIs, bench mentors, and research groups and seeks to foster excellence in the design of short-term research experiences for students. They emphasize projects co-created by PIs and bench mentors, accessible techniques that can be mastered in a few weeks, and strategies enabling interns to develop their own mental model of the research question and approach. Although tailored primarily to full-time summer internships for individual students in an academic research setting, this advice may be applicable to short-term, mentored research experiences in multiple settings."

    "content": "<p>by Hiroyuki Ichijo, Yuichiro Kawamura, Tomoya Nakamura</p>\n\nHow animals process information, compute, and execute behaviors is a central question in neuroscience and computational biology. Predators attack prey by chasing or ambushing them, while prey respond with escaping or freezing. These behaviors are fundamental for survival. Uncovering functions of such behaviors requires an understanding not only of the implementation of neuronal circuits but also of the underlying algorithms and computation. However, how animals respond to predators or prey depending on whether they can detect them from a distance remains unclear. Here, we modeled and analyzed attack and defense behaviors with game theory. Using encounter probabilities to construct payoff matrices under a sensory\u2013motor algorithm that lacked directional information, we identified the corresponding equilibrium behaviors for the agents (predators and prey). Different detection distances yielded distinct Nash equilibrium behaviors, representing a computational mechanism that can account for diverse attack and defense behaviors. The games based on interactions among multiple predators and prey were, in most cases, non-constant-sum and positive-sum games. Measured payoffs of Nash equilibrium behaviors indicated that the predators were able to increase their payoffs by attacking, and the prey were also able to increase their payoffs even in the presence of predators. These results suggest that each of the agents initiates attack and defense behaviors. Moreover, Nash equilibrium behaviors were also identified under a simpler non-sensory motor algorithm. Despite the similarity, the non-sensory motor algorithm and the sensory\u2013motor algorithm had distinct adaptive significance. The sensory\u2013motor algorithm produced substantially greater prey payoffs. By implementing these algorithms, agents interact in ways that give rise to payoff matrices from which various Nash equilibrium behaviors can be mathematically derived under different conditions. Furthermore, this approach offers an experimental framework for understanding behavioral evolution and suggests a possible difference in evolutionary mechanisms of attack and defense behaviors."

    "content": "<p>by Mengqi Hu, Syed Bilal Jilani, Daniel G. Olson, Costas D. Maranas</p>\n\nKinetic models mechanistically link enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations, and allosteric regulation to metabolic reaction fluxes. This coupling allows for the quantitative elucidation of the dynamics of the evolution of metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes as a function of time. So far, most large-scale kinetic model parameterizations are carried out using mostly steady-state flux measurements supplemented with metabolomics and/or proteomics data when available. Even though the parameterized kinetic model can trace a temporal evolution of the system, lack of anchoring to temporal data reduces confidence in the dynamics predictions. Notably, the simulation of enzymatic cascade reactions requires a full description of the dynamics of the system as a steady-state is not applicable given that all measured metabolite concentrations vary with time. Here we describe how kinetic parameters fitted to the dynamics of single-enzyme assays remain accurate for the simulation of multi-enzyme cell-free systems. Herein, we demonstrate two extensions for the Kinetic Estimation Tool Capturing Heterogeneous datasets Using Pyomo (KETCHUP) software tool for parameterizing a kinetic model of the cell-free kinetics of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH) through the use of time-course data across various initial conditions. An implemented extension of KETCHUP allowing for the reconciliation of measurement time-lag errors present in datasets was used to parameterize kinetic models using multiple datasets. By combining the kinetic parameters identified by the FDH and BDH assays, accurate simulation of the binary FDH-BDH system was achieved."

    "content": "<p>by Raj Magesh Gauthaman, Brice M\u00e9nard, Michael F. Bonner</p>\n\nHow does the human brain encode complex visual information? While previous research has characterized individual dimensions of visual representation in cortex, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how visual information is organized across the full range of neural population activity. Here, analyzing fMRI responses to natural scenes across multiple individuals, we discover that neural representations in human visual cortex follow a remarkably consistent scale-free organization\u2014their variance decay is consistent with a power-law distribution, detected across four orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. This scale-free structure appears consistently across multiple visual regions and across individuals, suggesting it reflects a fundamental organizing principle of visual processing. Critically, when we align neural responses across individuals using hyperalignment, we find that these representational dimensions are largely shared between people, revealing a universal high-dimensional spectrum of visual information that emerges despite individual differences in brain anatomy and visual experience. Traditional analysis approaches in cognitive neuroscience have focused primarily on a small number of high-variance dimensions, potentially missing crucial aspects of visual representation. Our results demonstrate that visual information is distributed across the full dimensionality of cortical activity in a systematic way, thus revealing a key property of neural coding in visual cortex. These findings suggest that we need to move beyond low-dimensional characterizations to fully understand how the brain represents the visual world."

We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system.

    "content": "<p>by Marko A. Ruslim, Martin J. Spencer, Hinze Hogendoorn, Hamish Meffin, Yanbo Lian, Anthony N. Burkitt</p>\n\nMany experimental and computational studies deal with sparseness, balance, and decorrelation in neural networks and explain the presence of these properties as fulfilling requirements related to optimum energy efficiency, network stability, and information representation. These studies leave the question of <i>how</i> these properties arise in the brain unanswered. The present study attempts to address this question using a model built upon the experimentally observed properties of neural responses, homeostasis, and synaptic plasticity. The experimentally observed properties of sparseness, balance, and decorrelation are then expected to emerge from this substrate. A spiking neural model of the primary visual cortex (V1) was investigated. Populations of both inhibitory and excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with recurrent connections were provided with spiking input from simulated ON and OFF neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This network was provided with natural image stimuli as input. All synapses underwent learning using spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules. A homeostatic rule adjusted the weights and thresholds of each neuron based on target homeostatic spiking rates and mean synaptic input values. These experimentally grounded rules resulted in a number of the expected properties of information representation. The network showed a temporally sparse spike <i>response</i> to inputs and this was associated with a sparse <i>code</i> with Gabor-like receptive fields. The network was balanced at both slow and fast time scales; increased excitatory input was balanced by increased inhibition. This balance was associated with decorrelated firing that was observed as population sparseness. This population sparseness was both the cause and result of the decorrelation of receptive fields. These observed emergent properties (balance, temporal sparseness, population sparseness, and decorrelation) indicate that the network is implementing expected principles of information processing: efficient coding, information maximization (\u2019infomax\u2019), and a lateral or single-layer form of predictive coding. These emergent features of the network were shown to be robust to randomized jitter of the values of key simulation parameters."

    "content": "<p>by Jyotika Bahuguna, Timothy Verstynen, Jonathan E. Rubin</p>\n\nAll mammals exhibit flexible decision policies that depend, at least in part, on the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) pathways. Yet understanding how the complex connectivity, dynamics, and plasticity of CBGT circuits translate into experience-dependent shifts of decision policies represents a longstanding challenge in neuroscience. Here we present the results of a computational approach to address this problem. Specifically, we simulated decisions during the early learning process driven by CBGT circuits under baseline, unrewarded conditions using a spiking neural network, and fit an evidence accumulation model to the resulting behavior. Using canonical correlation analysis, we then replicated the identification of three control ensembles (<i>responsiveness</i>, <i>pliancy</i> and <i>choice</i>) within CBGT circuits, with each of these subnetworks mapping to a specific configuration of the evidence accumulation process. We subsequently simulated learning in a simple two-choice task with one optimal (i.e., rewarded) target and found that, during early stages of learning, feedback-driven dopaminergic plasticity on cortico-striatal synapses effectively increases reward rate over time. The learning-related changes in the decision policy can be decomposed in terms of the contributions of each control ensemble, whose influence is driven by sequential reward prediction errors on individual trials. Our results provide a clear and simple mechanism for how dopaminergic plasticity shifts subnetworks within CBGT circuits so as to increase reward rate by strategically modulating how evidence is used to drive decisions."

We introduce Delphi Revision Forecast (Delphi-RF), a real-time data revision forecasting framework using nonparametric quantile regression, applicable to both counts and proportions (fractions) in public health reporting. By incorporating all available revisions up to a given estimation date, Delphi-RF models revision dynamics and generates distributional forecasts of finalized surveillance values. Applied to daily COVID-19 data (insurance claims, antigen tests, confirmed cases) and weekly dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) case counts, Delphi-RF delivers accurate revision forecasts, particularly in early reporting stages. In addition, it improves computational efficiency by more than 10-100x compared to existing methods, making it a scalable solution for real-time public health surveillance."

Specifically, users can utilize the PseudoknotVisualizer as a PyMOL extension, applying it directly to RNA molecules loaded in PyMOL. Additionally, a Command Line Interface (CLI) is provided, allowing users to generate coloring commands in Chimera or PyMOL formats, which can then be manually copied and pasted for visualization. By facilitating the clear depiction of pseudoknots in RNA tertiary structures, this tool addresses significant challenges in the identification and visualization of pseudoknots in RNA structural analysis, thereby enhancing research productivity and expanding potential applications in molecular biology.\nAvailability and implementation: PseudoknotVisualizer is freely available at https://github.com/TakumiOtagaki/PseudoknotVisualizer."

    "content": "<p>by Guillaume Mestdagh, Alexis De Angeli, Christophe Godin</p>\n\nPlant cells control their volume by regulating the osmotic potential of their cytoplasm and vacuole. Water is attracted into the cell as the result of a cascade of solute exchanges between the cell subcompartments and the cell surroundings, which are governed by chemical, electrostatic and mechanical forces. Due to this multi-physics aspect and to couplings between volume changes and chemical effects, modeling these exchanges remains a challenge that has only been partially addressed. As interest for multi-compartment models grows in the plant cell community, this challenge calls for new modeling strategies. In this paper, we introduce an energy-based approach to couple chemical, electrical and mechanical processes taking place between several subcompartments of a plant cell. The contributions of all physical effects are gathered in an energy function, which allows us to derive the equations satisfied by each variable in a systematic way. We illustrate the properties of this modular, unified approach on the modeling of ion and water transport in a guard cell during stoma opening. We represent the stoma opening process as a quasi-static evolution driven by hydrogen pumps in the plasma and vacuolar membranes, and we show that the new formalism explains why the system varies in a particular direction in response to perturbations. Additional numerical simulations allow us to investigate the role of each hydrogen pump in this process. Altogether, we show that this energy-based approach highlights a hierarchy between the forces involved in the system, and to dissect the role of each physical effect in the complex behavior of the system."

    "content": "<p>by Matt Combes, Nathan Brown, Robin N. Thompson, Alexander Mastin, Peter Crow, Stephen Parnell</p>\n\nInvasive plant pests and pathogens cause substantial environmental and economic damage. Visual inspection remains a central tenet of plant health surveys, but its sensitivity (probability of correctly identifying the presence of a pest) and specificity (probability of correctly identifying the absence of a pest) are not routinely quantified. As knowing sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection is critical for effective contingency planning and outbreak management, we address this deficiency using empirical data and statistical analyses. Twenty-three citizen scientist surveyors assessed up to 175 labelled oak trees for three symptoms of acute oak decline. The same trees were also assessed by an expert who has monitored these individual trees annually for over a decade. The sensitivity and specificity of surveyors was calculated using the expert data as the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 (i.e., assuming perfect sensitivity and specificity). The utility of an approach using Bayesian modelling to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection in the absence of a rarely available \u2018gold-standard\u2019 dataset was then examined with simulated plant health survey datasets. There was large variation in sensitivity and specificity between surveyors and between different symptoms, although the sensitivity of detecting a symptom was positively related to the frequency of the symptom on a tree. By leveraging surveyor observations of two symptoms from a minimum of 80 trees on two sites, with reliable prior knowledge of sites with a higher (~0.6) and lower (~0.3) true disease prevalence we show that sensitivity and specificity can be estimated without \u2018gold-standard\u2019 data using Bayesian modelling. We highlight that sensitivity and specificity will depend on the symptoms of a pest or disease, the individual surveyor, and the survey protocol. This has consequences for how surveys are designed to detect and monitor outbreaks, as well as the interpretation of survey data that is used to inform outbreak management."

The framework supports flexible model structures that incorporate demographic information, age-stratified contact matrices, and dynamic public health interventions. A key feature of Epydemix is its integration of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to perform parameter inference and model calibration through comparison between observed and simulated data. The package offers a range of ABC methods such as simple rejection sampling, simulation-budget-constrained rejection, and Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC). Epydemix is modular, and supports ABC-based calibration both for models defined within the package and for those developed externally. To demonstrate the computational framework capabilities, we discuss usage examples that include (i) simulating an intervention-driven model with time-varying parameters, and (ii) benchmarking calibration performance using synthetic epidemic data. We further illustrate the use of the package in a retrospective case study that includes scenario projections under alternative intervention assumptions. By lowering the barrier for the implementation of computational and inference approaches, Epydemix makes epidemic modeling more accessible to a wider range of users, from academic researchers to public health professionals."

We aimed to characterize pathways of clinical progression associated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections using data from patients aged 0 to >90 years in an integrated healthcare system, whose encounters were monitored across all levels of acuity spanning virtual, ambulatory, and inpatient care settings. Using parametric survival models, we estimated probabilities of progression and distributions of time to progression from each setting to all higher-acuity settings on a cascade encompassing the following classes of events or encounters: symptoms onset; diagnostic testing; telehealth or other virtual care appointment; outpatient physician office visit; urgent care presentation; emergency department presentation; hospital admission; mechanical ventilation; and death. Our analyses included data from 59,668, 22,705, and 1,668 episodes associated with positive SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV tests, respectively, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. First clinical encounters occurred in inpatient settings for only 4.7%, 3.4%, and 18.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes, respectively, with median times (interquartile range) of 6.8 (3.6-13.2), 6.6 (3.5-12.1), and 6.4 (3.8-10.6) days from symptoms onset to admission. Overall, 7.9% of SARS-CoV-2 episodes, 5.8% of influenza episodes, and 33.8% of RSV episodes resulted in inpatient admission, ventilation, or death. Between 40.4-62.1%, 71.6-87.3%, and 47.9-58.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV infections, respectively, had encounters in lower-acuity virtual care, outpatient, or urgent care settings. For all three viruses, the proportions of cases receiving care at each level of acuity increased with older age and greater numbers of comorbid conditions. Median durations of hospital stay were 4.2 (2.6, 7.3), 4.0 (2.3, 6.8), and 4.3 (2.5, 7.4) days for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes resulting in admission. These estimates provide a basis for modeling real-world clinical care requirements and the progression of respiratory viral infections."

In the lung, it is found in macrophages, bronchial and epithelial alveolar cells type 2, leading to pulmonary emphysema. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism underlying the formation of \u03b11-antitrypsin inclusion bodies remain elusive. In this study, we combine equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the intricate process of \u03b11-antitrypsin condensate formation and maturation. Our mechanistic model explains cluster accumulation\u2014specifically the onset of this pathogenesis\u2014through the emergence of phase-separated liquid-like protein droplets, which subsequently undergo inter-protein <i>\u03b2</i>-sheet transitions between misfolded variants, resulting in solid-like clusters. We find that this mechanism only applies to the misfolded variant, Z-\u03b11-antitrypsin, which phase-separates driven by its disordered C-terminus. In contrast, the native protein, M-\u03b11-antitrypsin, shows much lower propensity to phase-separate and later form kinetically trapped aggregates. Furthermore, we explore how Z-\u03b11-antitrypsin exhibits an increased capacity to form condensates near external walls with different types of interactions. Such conditions can be similar to those found within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where phase separation and hardening take place. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular basis of \u03b11-antitrypsin-related disorders and provide valuable microscopic insights for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting protein misfolding and aggregation-related disorders."

Hancox, Henggui Zhang</p>\n\nPatients with abbreviated cardiac repolarization are at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular and atrial fibrillation (AF). In this computational simulation study, we investigated pro-arrhythmic effects of loss-of-function missense mutations in <i>CACNA1C</i> (A39V and G490R Cav1.2) identified in patients with a phenotype combining Brugada syndrome with shorter-than-normal QT intervals. Biophysically-detailed computational models of human atrial cells were modified to incorporate the functional impact of the <i>CACNA1C</i> encoded A39V and G490R mutations on the reduction of the maximal conductance (g<sub>CaL</sub>) of L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Varying levels of g<sub>CaL</sub> reduction were considered. Effects of deficient LTCC on atrial excitation and propagation were investigated by using cellular and multi-dimensional tissue models that included a one-dimensional atrial strand, a two-dimensional idealized atrial sheet and three-dimensional human atria with realistic anatomical structure and detailed electrophysiology. Our results showed that reduced LTCC activity from the <i>CACNA1C</i> A39V and G490R mutations accelerated atrial repolarization, leading to shortened action potential duration and effective refractory period, as well as the loss of their rate-dependence. At the tissue level, decreased g<sub>CaL</sub> shortened the wavelength of atrial excitation waves, slowed down atrial conduction velocity (CV) at low pacing rates but increased it at high pacing rates. It also showed bi-phasic arrhythmogenic effects in One-dimensional (1D), Two-dimensional (2D) and Three-dimensional (3D) tissue simulations. A large reduction in I<sub>CaL</sub> increased tissue susceptibility to initiation and maintenance of atrial re-entrant excitation waves, while a moderate reduction showed anti-arrhythmic effects due to an increased meandering area of re-entrant excitation waves that led to early self-termination of the reentry. In conclusion, this study provides new mechanistic insights into understanding of biphasic effects of loss-of-function LTCC mutations on atrial pro-arrhythmias."

Parts of the foreign DNA, called spacers, are incorporated into the CRISPR array which constitutes the immune memory. The orientation of CRISPR arrays is crucial for analyzing and understanding the functionality of CRISPR systems and their targets. Several methods have been developed to identify the orientation of a CRISPR array. To predict the orientation, different methods use different features such as the repeat sequences between the spacers, the location of the leader sequence, the Cas genes, or PAMs. However, those features are often not sufficient to predict the orientation with certainty, or different methods disagree.\nRemarkably, almost all CRISPR systems have been found to insert spacers in a polarized manner at the leader end of the array. We introduce <i>CRISPR-evOr</i>, a method that leverages the resulting patterns to predict the acquisition orientation for (a group of) CRISPR arrays by reconstructing and comparing the likelihood of their evolutionary history with respect to both possible acquisition orientations. The new method is independent of Cas type, leader existence and location, and transcription orientation.\n<i>CRISPR-evOr</i> is thus particularly useful for arrays that other CRISPR orientation tools cannot predict confidently and to verify or resolve conflicting predictions from existing tools. <i>CRISPR-evOr</i> currently confidently predicts the orientation of 28.3% of the arrays in the considered subset of CRISPRCasdb, which other tools like CRISPRDirection and CRISPRstrand cannot reliably orient. As our tool leverages evolutionary information we expect this percentage to grow in the future when more closely related arrays will be available. Additionally, <i>CRISPR-evOr</i> provides confident decisions for rare subtypes of CRISPR arrays, where knowledge about repeats and leaders and their orientation is limited."

Effective supervision can enhance student learning, foster independent thinking, and improve both the quality and impact of student work, while also contributing to a positive and inclusive research culture. In this article, we present ten simple rules to guide supervisors, particularly those with limited supervision experience, such as early-career researchers, in supporting undergraduate and master\u2019s students through their research journeys. These rules emphasise balancing project requirements with student interests, managing scope, fostering community integration, promoting open science practices, and providing structured yet flexible guidance.

    "content": "<p>by Amin Akhshi, Michael G. Metzen, Maurice J. Chacron, Anmar Khadra</p>\n\nBurst firing is an important property of neuronal activity, thought to enhance sensory encoding. While previous studies show significant differences in burst firing between <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> conditions, how burst firing contributes to neural coding <i>in vivo</i> and how it is modulated by underlying biophysical mechanisms when neurons are under active synaptic bombardments remains poorly understood. Here, we combined intracellular recordings and computational modeling to investigate how cellular and synaptic mechanisms can explain the <i>in vivo</i> firing activity of electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells in <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>. We developed a biophysically detailed compartmental model incorporating voltage-gated currents, NMDA receptor-mediated calcium (Ca<sup>2\u2009+\u2009</sup>) influx, Ca<sup>2\u2009+\u2009</sup>-activated SK channels, Ca<sup>2\u2009+\u2009</sup> mobilization, and stochastic synaptic inputs to reproduce <i>in vivo</i> firing activities of ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, using bifurcation analysis, we identified dynamical transitions between quiescent, tonic, and bursting regimes, governed by interactions among SK conductance, NMDA receptor activation, and applied current. Model parameters were optimized against <i>in vivo</i> data, accurately reproducing action potential waveforms and temporal dynamics, including characteristic bimodal interspike interval distributions reflecting intra- and inter-burst intervals. We further developed a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model incorporating dual adaptation variables and stochastic noise. This simplified phenomenological model successfully captured burst firing comparable to that observed in the biophysical model and recorded data, while replicating diverse firing patterns observed across the population. Finally, parameter sensitivity analysis revealed slow adaptation dynamics and noise intensity as key determinants of spiking variability within cells. Overall, our modeling results demonstrate that <i>in vivo</i> bursting arises from synergistic interactions between intrinsic conductances (e.g., NMDA-SK coupling), Ca<sup>2\u2009+\u2009</sup> mobilization, and synaptic stochasticity, offering a potential reconciliation for discrepancies with <i>in vitro</i> firing activity. The models provide mechanistic insights into how background synaptic activity modulates burst firing."

Examining how these interactions change over time offers valuable insights into the developmental and adaptive processes that drive an organism\u2019s lifecycle. Moreover, incorporating structural prior information can substantially enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the estimated sparse dynamic gene network. Methods previously proposed in the literature cannot simultaneously model sparse time-varying co-expression network structure and have the power-law degree distribution. Additionally, there is a demand of time-efficient, memory-light software implementations and possibility to utilize repeated measures at each time-point (if available). In this paper, we introduce the time-varying scale-free graphical lasso (tvsfglasso), a novel scalable framework for estimating high-dimensional time-varying gene co-expression networks under the assumption that these networks simultaneously exhibit sparse and a scale-free structure. We utilize fast algorithms developed for the graphical lasso (glasso), which makes tvsfglasso a scalable tool for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate the performance of tvsfglasso using both simulated and real-world dynamic gene expression time series datasets, demonstrating its capability to detect temporal changes in gene associations. Our results highlight the potential of tvsfglasso to advance the understanding of dynamic gene networks, making this estimator useful for more accurate modeling of complex biological processes."

    "content": "<p>by Ari E. Kahn, Dani S. Bassett, Nathaniel D. Daw</p>\n\nDecisions in humans and other organisms depend, in part, on learning and using models that capture the statistical structure of the world, including the long-run expected outcomes of our actions. One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD(\u03bb>0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD(<i>\u03bb</i>) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD(<i>\u03bb</i>) alongside an additional predictive model of recency. The relatively large <i>\u03bb</i> we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions."

    "content": "<p>by Maarten Afschrift, Dinant Kistemaker, Maarten Bobbert, Friedl De Groote</p>\n\nPhysics-based simulation generate movement patterns based on a neuro-musculoskeletal model without relying on experimental movement data, offering a powerful approach to study how neuro-musculoskeletal properties shape locomotion. Yet, simulated gait patterns and metabolic powers do not always agree with experiments, pointing to modeling errors reflecting gaps in our understanding. Here, we systematically evaluated the predictive capability of simulations based on a 3D musculoskeletal model to predict gait mechanics, muscle activity, and metabolic power across gait conditions. We simulated the effect of adding mass to body segments, variations in walking speed, inclined walking, and crouched walking. We chose tasks that are relatively straightforward to model to limit the contribution of errors in modeling the task to prediction errors. The simulations predicted stride frequency and walking kinematics with reasonable accuracy but underestimated variation in metabolic power across conditions. In particular, simulations underestimated changes in metabolic power with respect to level walking in tasks requiring substantial positive mechanical work, such as incline walking (27% underestimation). We identified two possible errors in simulated metabolic power. First, the phenomenological metabolic power model produced high maximal mechanical efficiency (average 0.58) during concentric contractions, compared to the observed 0.2\u20130.3 in laboratory experiments. Second, when we multiplied the mechanical work with more realistic estimates of mechanical efficiency (i.e., 0.25), simulations overestimated the metabolic power by 84%. This suggests that positive work by muscle fibers was overestimated in the simulations. This overestimation may be caused by several assumptions and errors in (the parameters of) the musculoskeletal model including its interaction with the environment or in the cost function. This study highlights the need for more accurate models of musculoskeletal mechanics, energetics, passive elastic structures, and neural control (e.g., optimality criteria) to improve the realism of human movement simulations. Validating simulations across a broad range of conditions is important to pinpoint shortcomings in model-based simulations."

Ross, Andreas Handel</p>\nIntroduction <p>Influenza continuously evolves to escape population immunity, which makes formulating a vaccine challenging. Antigenic differences between vaccine strains and circulating strains can affect vaccine effectiveness (VE). Quantifying the antigenic difference between vaccine strains and circulating strains can aid interpretation of VE, and several antigenic distance metrics have been discussed in the literature. Here, we compare how the predicted breadth of vaccine-induced antibody response varies when different metrics are used to calculate antigenic distance.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed data from a seasonal influenza vaccine cohort that collected serum samples from 2013/14 \u2013 2017/18 at three study sites. The data include pre- and post-vaccination HAI titers to the vaccine strains and a panel of heterologous strains. We used that data to calculate four different antigenic distance measures between assay strains and vaccine strains: difference in year of isolation (temporal), <i>p</i>-Epitope (sequence), Grantham\u2019s distance (biophysical), and antigenic cartography distance (serological). We analyzed agreement between the four metrics using Spearman\u2019s correlation and intraclass correlation. We then fit Bayesian generalized additive mixed-effects models to predict the effect of antigenic distance on post-vaccination titer after controlling for confounders and analyzed the pairwise difference in predictions between metrics.</p> Results <p>The four antigenic distance metrics had low or moderate correlation for influenza subtypes A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. A(H3N2) distances were highly correlated. We found that after accounting for pre-vaccination titer, study site, and repeated measurements across individuals, the predicted post-vaccination titers conditional on antigenic distance and subtype were nearly identical across antigenic distance metrics, with A(H3N2) showing the only notable deviation between metrics, despite higher agreement for that subtype.</p> Discussion <p>Despite moderate correlation among metrics, we found that different antigenic distance metrics generated similar predictions about breadth of vaccine response. Costly titer assays for antigenic cartography may not be needed when simpler sequence-based metrics suffice for quantifying vaccine breadth.</p>"

    "content": "<p>by John M. Marshall, Shuyi Yang, Jared B. Bennett, Igor Filipovi\u0107, Gordana Ra\u0161i\u0107</p>\n\nClose-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters for several aquatic and terrestrial species. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> as a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods."

    "content": "<p>by Nan Sheng, Yunzhi Liu, Ling Gao, Lei Wang, Lan Huang, Yan Wang</p>\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in cancer progression, invasion, and response to treatment, particularly in regulating anticancer drug resistance and sensitivity. Identifying potential human miRNA-drug associations (MDAs) that manifest as resistance or sensitivity relationships offers valuable insights for cancer treatment and drug development. With the growing availability of biological data, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools to complement experimental approaches. However, limited attention has been paid to computational prediction of MDAs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically rely on known MDA information, overlooking the valuable insights available from multi-source data related to miRNAs and drugs. In this study, we present a multi-view fusion-based graph convolutional network with attention mechanism (MGCNA) to predict miRNA-associated drug resistance/sensitivity. Specifically, MGCNA integrates macro- and micro- level information of miRNAs and drugs to construct multi-view node features from different perspectives. The proposed multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder obtains miRNA and disease features from different views and learns adaptive importance weights of the embedding using an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on manually curated benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCNA outperforms existing baseline methods. Case studies of two common drugs further establish MGCNA\u2019s effectiveness in discovering novel MDAs."

    "content": "<p>by Tianjiao Zhang, Haibin Zhu</p>\n\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deciphers cell type-specific co-expression networks to resolve biological functions but remains constrained by data sparsity and compositional biases. Conventional metacells construction strategies mitigate sparsity by aggregating transcriptionally similar cells but often neglect systematic biases introduced by compositional data. This problem leads to spurious co-expression correlations and obscuring biologically meaningful interactions. Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we demonstrate that uncontrolled library size variance in traditional metacells inflates false-positive correlations and distorts co-expression networks. Here, we present LSMetacell (Library Size-stabilized Metacells), a computational framework that explicitly stabilizes library sizes across metacells to reduce compositional noise while preserving cellular heterogeneity. LSMetacell addresses this by stabilizing library sizes during metacells aggregation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of downstream analyses such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Applied to a postmortem Alzheimer\u2019s disease brain scRNA-seq dataset, LSMetacell revealed robust, cell type-specific co-expression modules enriched for disease-relevant pathways, outperforming the conventional metacells approach. Our work establishes a principled strategy for resolving compositional biases in scRNA-seq data, advancing the reliability of co-expression network inference in studying complex biological systems. This framework provides a generalizable solution for improving transcriptional analyses in single-cell studies."

Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering."

    "content": "<p>by Pantelis Vafidis, Antonio Rangel</p>\n\nAnimals learn to predict external contingencies from experience through a process of conditioning. A natural mechanism for conditioning is stimulus substitution, whereby the neuronal response to the CS becomes increasingly identical to that of the US. We propose a recurrent neural network model of stimulus substitution which leverages two forms of inductive bias pervasive in the cortex: representational inductive bias in the form of mixed stimulus representations, and architectural inductive bias in the form of two-compartment pyramidal neurons that have been shown to serve as a fundamental unit of cortical associative learning. The properties of these neurons allow for a biologically plausible learning rule that implements stimulus substitution, utilizing only information available locally at the synapses. We show that the model generates a wide array of conditioning phenomena, and can learn large numbers of associations with an amount of training commensurate with animal experiments, without relying on parameter fine-tuning for each individual experimental task. In contrast, we show that commonly used Hebbian rules fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations with mixed selectivity, and require task-specific parameter fine-tuning. Our framework highlights the importance of multi-compartment neuronal processing in the cortex, and showcases how it might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge."

However, even isogenic individuals show heterogeneity in natural aging rate and responsiveness to pro-longevity interventions, limiting translational potential. Using RNAseq analysis of young, isogenic, subpopulations of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> selected solely on the basis of the splicing pattern of an in vivo minigene reporter that is predictive of future life expectancy, we find a strong correlation in young animals between predicted life span and alternative splicing of mRNAs related to lipid metabolism. The activity of two RNA splicing factors, Reversed Polarity-1 (REPO-1) and Splicing Factor 1 (SFA-1), early in life is necessary for <i>C. elegans</i> response to specific longevity interventions and leads to context-specific changes to fat content that is mirrored by knockdown of their direct target POD-2/ACC1. Moreover, POD-2/ACC1 is required for the same longevity interventions as REPO-1/SFA-1. In addition, early inhibition of REPO-1 renders animals refractory to late onset suppression of the TORC1 pathway. Together, we propose that splicing factor activity establishes a cellular landscape early in life that enables responsiveness to specific longevity interventions and may explain variance in efficacy between individuals."

Eickhoff, Sarah Genon</p>\n\nThe link between brain health and risk/protective factors for non-communicable diseases (such as high blood pressure, high body mass index, diet, smoking, physical activity, etc.) is increasingly acknowledged. However, the specific effects that these factors have on brain health are still poorly understood, delaying their implementation in precision brain health. Here, we studied the multivariate relationships between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and brain structure, including cortical thickness (CT) and gray matter volume (GMV). Furthermore, we adopted a systems-level perspective to understand such relationships, by characterizing the cortical patterns (yielded in association to risk factors) with regards to brain morphological and functional features, as well as with neurotransmitter systems. Similarly, we related the pattern of risk/protective factors dimensions with a peripheral marker of inflammation. First, we identified latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT and GMV across the whole cortex. Data was obtained from the UK Biobank (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20097,370, age range\u2009=\u200946\u201381 years). We used regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA) embedded in a machine learning framework. This approach allows us to capture inter-individual variability in a multivariate association and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk/protective factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by performing correlations (spin tests) between them and different brain patterns of structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. The association between the risk/protective factors pattern and C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of inflammation) was examined using Spearman correlation. We found two significant and partly replicable latent dimensions. One latent dimension linked cardiometabolic health to brain patterns of CT and GMV and was consistent across sexes. The other latent dimension linked physical robustness (including non-fat mass and strength) to patterns of CT and GMV, with the association to GMV being consistent across sexes and the association to CT appearing only in men. The CT and GMV patterns of both latent dimensions were associated to the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems. Finally, the cardiometabolic health dimension was correlated to CRP, while physical robustness was only very weakly associated to it. We observed robust, multi-level and multivariate links between both cardiometabolic health and physical robustness with respect to CT, GMV, and neurotransmitter systems. Interestingly, we found that cardiometabolic health and physical robustness are associated with not only increases in CT or GMV, but also with decreases of CT or GMV in some brain regions. Our results also suggested a role for low-grade chronic inflammation in the association between cardiometabolic health and brain structural health. These findings support the relevance of adopting a holistic perspective in health, by integrating neurocognitive and physical health. Moreover, our findings contribute to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. In this perspective, future studies should further examine the effects of risk/protective factors on different brain regions in order to deepen our understanding of the clinical significance of such increased and decreased CT and GMV."

Sullivan</p>\n\nMicrobiomes influence diverse ecosystems, and viruses increasingly appear to impose key constraints. While viromics has expanded genomic catalogs, host identification for these viruses remains challenging due to the limitations in scaling cultivation-based approaches and the uncertain reliability and relative low resolution of <i>in silico</i> predictions \u2013 particularly for understudied viral taxa. Towards this, Hi-C proximity ligation uses sequenced, cross-linked virus and host genomic fragments to infer virus-host linkages and has now been applied in at least 10 studies. However, its accuracy remains unknown. Here we assess Hi-C performance in recovering virus-host interactions using synthetic communities (SynComs) composed of four marine bacterial strains and nine phages with known interactions and then apply optimized bioinformatic protocols to natural soil samples. In SynComs, standard Hi-C sample preparations and analyses showed poor normalized contact score performance (26% specificity, 100% sensitivity, incorrect matches up to class level) that could be dramatically improved by <i>Z</i>-score filtering (<i>Z</i>\u2009\u2265\u20090.5, 99% specificity), though at reduced sensitivity (62% down from 100%). Detection limits were established as reproducibility was poor below minimal phage abundances of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL. Applying optimized bioinformatic protocols to natural soil samples, we compared virus-host linkages inferred from proximity-ligated Hi-C sequencing with predictions generated by <i>in silico</i> homology-based and machine learning-based bioinformatic approaches. Prior to <i>Z</i>-score thresholding, agreement was relatively high at the phylum to family levels (72%), but not at the genus (43%) or species (15%) levels. <i>Z</i>-score thresholding reduced sensitivity (only 34% of predictions were retained), with only modest improvements in congruence with bioinformatic methods (48% or 18% at genus or species levels, respectively). Regardless, this led to 79 genus-level-congruent virus-host linkages and 293 new ones revealed by Hi-C alone, i.e., providing many new virus-host interactions to explore in already well-studied climate-critical soils. Overall, these findings provide empirical benchmarks and methodological guidelines to improve the accuracy and reliability of Hi-C for virus-host linkage studies in complex microbial communities."

Growing evidence suggests that sleep facilitates this flow, yet the role of homeostatic sleep mechanisms remains largely unknown. In a circadian-controlled sleep and sleep deprivation study in humans, we used accelerated neuroimaging to investigate how sleep pressure and slow-wave-rich sleep affect low-frequency brain pulsations (LFPs; 0.012\u20130.034 Hz) as well as brain pulsations originating from the respiratory and cardiac cycles. These pulsations cause movement of CSF and brain tissue which may facilitate waste clearance. We also examined the origin of LFPs through pharmacological vasodilation of the cerebral vasculature with the adrenergic antagonist carvedilol in a randomized, cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design (NCT03576664). We find that sleep deprivation increases LFPs more than nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep does, with LFPs during sleep correlating with cognitive measures of sleep pressure. Conversely, NREM sleep (combined stages N2 and N3) enhances brain pulsations driven by the respiration and cardiac cycles, with more pronounced effects in gray and white matter than in the ventricles. The strength of these brain pulsations escalates with sleep depth (N3\u2009>\u2009N2) and correlates with EEG delta power, a measure of slow wave activity. Moreover, carvedilol dampens LFPs, supporting that these reflect cerebral vasomotion. In summary, our findings indicate that heightened sleep pressure promotes vasomotion, whereas slow-wave-rich sleep amplifies respiration- and cardiac-driven brain pulsations, possibly indicating increased CSF flow to the brain. Together, this suggests that homeostatic sleep mechanisms are integral to human brain fluid dynamics and potentially also waste clearance."

    "content": "<p>by Shivani Sachdev, Swarnali Roy, Ross W. Cheloha</p>\n\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of plasma membrane-embedded signaling proteins. These receptors are involved in a wide array of physiological processes, marking them as attractive targets for drug development. Bitopic ligands, which are comprised of a pharmacophore that targets the receptor orthosteric site and a linked moiety that binds to a separate site, have considerable potential for addressing GPCR function. Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of novel bitopic conjugates consisting of a small molecule pharmacophore that activates the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) linked to antibody fragments (nanobodies, Nbs). This approach leverages the high-affinity and specificity binding of Nbs to non orthosteric sites on engineered A2AR variants to provide bitopic Nb-ligand conjugates that stimulate strong and enduring signaling responses. We further demonstrate that such bitopic conjugates can induce activation by spanning two distinct receptor protomers. This property enables the selective targeting of receptor pairs over either individual receptor, as a form of \u201clogic-gated\u201d activity. We showcase the broad applicability of bitopic conjugates in this context by demonstrating their activity in targeting several pairs of co-expressed receptors, including GPCR monomers from different classes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this dual-targeting strategy initiates signaling responses that diverge from those induced by monovalent ligands. The ability to target receptor pairs using Nb-ligand conjugates offers a powerful strategy with potential for cell type-selective signaling and implications for GPCR drug discovery efforts more broadly."

Miettinen</p>\n\nMarine phytoplankton face eco-evolutionary pressure to regulate their vertical position in the ocean to access light, which is abundant towards the surface, and nutrients, which are found deeper down the water column. All phytoplankton experience gravitational sinking, which can contribute to their vertical migration. However, the biophysical and molecular mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking have not been systematically characterized across taxa and environmental conditions. Here, we combine simulations with measurements of cell mass, volume, and composition to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on gravitational sinking in nine representative unicellular pico- and nanoplankton species. We find that gravitational sinking becomes faster in most species when starved, but the biophysical changes responsible for this vary across species and starvation conditions. For example, the faster sinking of <i>Chaetoceros calcitrans</i> is nearly exclusively driven by cell density whereas that of <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> is due to cell volume. On the molecular level, the altered sinking is predominantly attributed to changes in cellular dry contents, rather than water. For example, starch accumulation increases sinking in three green algae species, and lipid accumulation decreases sinking in <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Overall, our work reveals that phytoplankton physiology has evolved multiple mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking in response to starvation, possibly to support the vertical migration of the cell."

Daga</p>\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen provides the proper redox environment for disulfide bond formation, which is essential for the correct folding of proteins entering the secretory pathway and forming membranes. However, the precise mechanisms by which disruptions in protein folding within the ER activate proteostatic mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> the antineoplastic agent hydroxyurea (HU) induces a transient perinuclear ER expansion, Bip1 accumulation, and the clustering of nuclear pore complexes in a specific region of the nuclear envelope. This striking phenotype is mimicked by diamide (DIA), a specific inducer of thiol stress, and can be prevented or rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, suggesting that ER expansion results from disulfide stress. Furthermore, HU or DIA treatments resulted in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cytoplasmic foci containing Hsp104 disaggregase and Hsp70/Ssa1 chaperones. Our data show that HU impacts redox-dependent protein folding, impairs the secretory pathway, and activates specific proteostatic mechanisms in both the ER and the cytoplasm."

Cheng</p>\n\nTumors adapt their metabolism to sustain increased proliferation, rendering them particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in nutrient availability. However, the role of the tumor microenvironment in modulating sensitivity to nutrient restriction (NR) remains poorly understood. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> brain dedifferentiation neural stem cell (NSC) tumor model induced by Prospero (Pros) inhibition, we show that tumor sensitivity to NR is governed by the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) glia. We found that the SLC36 amino acid transporter Pathetic (Path) regulates brain branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) levels. Under NR, while wild-type buffers against low nutrient levels by upregulating Path, tumor glia down-regulate Path. Furthermore, Path is specifically required by the tumor (but not wildtype) BBB; its downregulation causes reduced cell cycle progression of BBB glial cells and, in turn, restricts NSC tumor growth. Path influences BBB glial cell cycle via the BCAA-mTor-S6K pathway, and its expression is controlled by Ilp6 levels and the Insulin/PI3K pathway. Overexpression of Path is sufficient to counteract the inhibitory effects of NR on tumor growth. These findings suggest that Path levels at the glial niche BBB play a key role in determining tumor sensitivity to NR."

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this function are unclear. Here, we used multielectrode arrays to record the local field potentials (LFPs) in the FPC of two macaques performing a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analogue and found that bursts of gamma and beta in FPC tracked counterfactual not current rule value. Moreover, we show that brief high-frequency microstimulation to a single trial causally affects both LFP activity in FPC, as well as rule-guided decision-making across successive trials. Following stimulation of FPC, we observed reduced exploration of the counterfactual rule prerule-change, as well as a delayed adaptation to the newly relevant rule postrule-change. A similar, multi-trial time-course disturbance to beta and gamma activity within FPC was also induced following single-trial microstimulation. These findings link neuronal activity in FPC with behavioral monitoring of the value of counterfactual rules and provide neural mechanistic insights into how FPC supports rule-based decision-making."

    "content": "<p>by Yiyang Wu, Xiangbin Teng, Yi Du</p>\n\nAuditory-motor synchronization, the alignment of body movements with rhythmic patterns in music, is a universal human behavior, yet its full scope remains incompletely understood. Through four experiments with 123 young nonmusicians, integrating eye-tracking, neurophysiological recordings, white matter structural imaging, and behavioral analysis, we reveal a previously unrecognized form of synchronization: spontaneous eye blinks synchronize with musical beats. Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. Electroencephalogram recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking. Blink synchronization performance was linked to white matter microstructure variation in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, a key sensorimotor pathway. Additionally, the strength of blink synchronization reflected the modulation of dynamic auditory attention. These findings establish blink synchronization as a novel behavioral paradigm, expanding the auditory-motor synchronization repertoire and highlighting the intricate interplay between music rhythms and oculomotor activity. This discovery underscores a cross-modal active sensing mechanism, offering new insights into embodied music perception, rhythm processing, and their potential clinical applications."

    "content": "<p>by Leah E. Escalante, James Hose, Jamie M. Ahrens, Hollis Howe, Norah Paulsen, Sofia J. Liss, Michael Place, Audrey P. Gasch</p>\n\nDown syndrome, caused by an extra copy of Chromosome 21, causes lifelong problems. One of the most common phenotypes among people with Down syndrome is premature aging, including early tissue decline, neurodegeneration, and shortened life span. Yet the reasons for premature systemic aging are a mystery and difficult to study in humans. Here we show that chromosome amplification in wild yeast also produces premature aging and shortens life span. Chromosome duplication disrupts nutrient-induced cell-cycle arrest, entry into quiescence, and cellular health during chronological aging, across genetic background and independent of which chromosome is amplified. Using a genomic screen, we discovered that these defects are due in part to aneuploidy-induced dysfunction in Ribosome Quality Control (RQC). We show that aneuploids entering quiescence display aberrant ribosome profiles, accumulate RQC intermediates, and harbor an increased load of protein aggregates compared to euploid cells. Although they maintain proteasome activity, aneuploids also show signs of ubiquitin dysregulation and sequestration into foci. Remarkably, inducing ribosome stalling in euploids produces similar aging phenotypes, while up-regulating limiting RQC subunits or poly-ubiquitin alleviates many of the aneuploid defects. We propose that the increased translational load caused by having too many mRNAs accelerates a decline in translational fidelity, contributing to premature aging."

To bridge these gaps, we developed Cell2Spatial, a computational framework that segments spatial spots at single-cell resolution, even when SC and ST datasets are not fully matched in cell types. The method integrates information-theoretic gene selection, spatially weighted likelihood modeling, and spatial hotspot detection to improve signal fidelity. A corrected saturation model calibrates library size against gene complexity, ensuring accurate cell count estimation in low-resolution ST. To enhance scalability and spatial coherence, Cell2Spatial incorporates neural-network-guided clustering and a cost-minimizing assignment algorithm that balances transcriptional similarity with spatial proximity. Evaluations on synthetic data demonstrated that Cell2Spatial consistently outperforms existing tools in reconstructing tissue architectures and cellular compositions, with particular strength in handling unmatched datasets. Applications to 10\u00d7 Visium data across mouse brain, human thymus, mouse kidney, and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex revealed detailed anatomical structures and developmental trajectories. Moreover, for high-resolution platforms including Xenium In Situ, Visium HD, and Slide-seqV2, Cell2Spatial remained robust despite reduced transcript capture, effectively delineating fine-scale spatial patterns in complex tissues. Collectively, these results highlight Cell2Spatial as a versatile framework that expands the analytical scope of ST and provides a powerful tool for uncovering the spatial organization of cellular function and tissue architecture."

To better understand this, we develop an experimental-computational pipeline to determine which neurons and networks are most active at different times of the day. We genetically mark active neurons of freely behaving mice at four times of the day with a c-Fos activity-dependent TRAP2 system. Neurons are imaged and digitized in 3D, and their molecular properties are inferred from the latest brain spatial transcriptomic dataset. We then develop a new computational method to analyze the network formed by the identified active neurons. Applying this pipeline, we observe region and layer-specific activation of neurons in the cortex, especially activation of layer five neurons at the end of the dark (wake) period. We also observe a shift in the balance of excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons versus inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons across the whole brain, especially in the thalamus. Moreover, as the dark (wake) period progresses, the network formed by the active neurons becomes less modular, and the hubs switch from subcortical regions, such as the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, to cortical regions in the default mode network. Taken together, we present a pipeline to understand which neurons and networks may be most activated in the mouse brain during an experimental protocol, and use this pipeline to understand how brain activity changes over the course of a day."

Both natural processes and organismal properties may contribute to promoting diversity. Here, we show that one such process, namely natural selection, and an organismal property, namely life history, interact in a feedback mechanism that promotes the emergence of diversity. We illustrate how this mechanism operates using various models of ecological diversification driven by intraspecific resource competition, in which both a niche trait that determines resource use and a life history trait can evolve. We find that natural selection acting on life history traits leads to increased competition, which, in the presence of ecological opportunity, facilitates niche diversification. As a consequence, the environmental conditions for diversification are more restrictive in the absence of life history evolution than in its presence. Our findings indicate a strong influence of life history evolution on ecological processes that in turn shape the origin of biodiversity. Our results call for a better integration of life history evolution and niche diversification in both theoretical and empirical realms."

Sack, Catherine Tallon-Baudry</p>\n\nInteroception refers to the brain\u2019s sensing of internal body state and encompasses various bodily systems, notably the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms. Beyond their roles in physiological regulation and emotional states, each of these visceral rhythms has been shown to influence brain activity and cognition, prompting for the development of various interpretative functional frameworks. However, both experimental data and functional hypothesis leave it unclear whether and how each visceral rhythm acts simultaneously and independently on brain activity. Here, we address this question by measuring in human participants how the corticospinal excitability of the motor system varies with the phase of each of the three visceral rhythms. We applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand region in primary motor cortex to elicit Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), whose amplitude reflects corticospinal excitability, and tested whether MEP amplitude depends on the phase of the simultaneously measured cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms. All three visceral rhythms were coupled to motor excitability with similar effect sizes at the group level. However, we found no relation between coupling strengths: participants displaying high coupling with one organ did not necessarily display high coupling to the other organs. These results indicate that independent mechanisms could underly the coupling between the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms and motor excitability. We further introduce the concept of individual interoceptive profiles and show that such interoceptive profiles obtained from objective coupling strength measures were not explained by self-reported awareness of the organ. Altogether, our results call for refined specifications of the frameworks offering a functional or clinical interpretation of viscera\u2013brain coupling taking into account both independent mechanisms and individual interoceptive profiles."

Bouret</p>\n\nThe hypothalamus is crucial for regulating essential bodily functions, including energy balance. It is an exceedingly complex and heterogeneous brain region that contains a variety of neuronal systems that are interconnected with each other. Among these, the melanocortin system, which comprises pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, displays a remarkable anatomical relationship with oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVH). Here, we demonstrate that OT neurons are instrumental in the development of the melanocortin system in mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of OT neurons during the first postnatal week selectively disrupts POMC and AgRP projections to the PVH, without affecting other target nuclei like the dorsomedial nucleus. This developmental role is age-dependent, as silencing OT neurons in juvenile or adult stages has no impact on melanocortin circuits. OT neurons release various neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, and their secretion can be modulated by chemogenetic manipulation. Expressing the botulinum toxin serotype B light chain in OT neurons reveals that their developmental actions rely on SNARE-mediated exocytosis. Moreover, administering an OT receptor antagonist during the first postnatal week leads to similar melanocortin circuit defects and long-term metabolic effects. Furthermore, neonatal chemogenetic activation of OT neurons rescues POMC circuit deficits in a mouse model of Prader\u2013Willi Syndrome. These findings reveal that OT acts as a paracrine neurotrophic factor orchestrating the development of melanocortin circuits during a restricted neonatal critical period."

While RNA modifications like N\u2076-methyladenosine (m\u2076A) regulate viral replication, their role in maintaining HIV-1 latency is poorly defined. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein RBM39 as a scaffold organizing an m\u2076A-dependent silencing complex that enforces viral latency. Through proteomic and functional analyses, we demonstrate that RBM39 recruits the m\u2076A reader YTHDC1 and the RNA helicase DDX5, forming a tripartite complex that accelerates Tat RNA decay and enforces viral quiescence. Genetic or pharmacological degradation of RBM39 (using the clinically explored molecular glue <i>indisulam</i>) potently reactivates latent HIV-1 in J-Lat cell models, primary CD4\u207a T cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH), and synergizes with established LRAs (Bryostatin-1, JQ-1, SAHA) to broadly activate proviral reservoirs. Our work reveals a previously unrecognized host pathway in which RBM39-organized RNA decay complexes silence HIV-1 through epitranscriptomic regulation of Tat. In addition to establishing RBM39 as a promising therapeutic target for addressing the limitations of current \u201cshock and kill\u201d strategies, our findings establish a novel mechanistic framework for m\u2076A-dependent regulation of viral gene expression. This framework may serve as a valuable reference for investigating similar regulatory mechanisms in other latent viral infections or oncogenic processes where RNA methylation plays a pivotal role."

Reddien</p>\n\nRegeneration can involve the coordination of pattern formation in an outgrowth with the spatial pattern of pre-existing tissues, such as along body axes. Planarian adult axis patterning serves as a robust context for uncovering the mechanisms of such pattern integration. We investigated how the dorsal\u2013ventral boundary (DVB), which surrounds the animal periphery at the dorsal\u2013ventral (DV) median plane, regulates anterior\u2013posterior (AP) axis growth and patterning. We define a spatial DVB gene expression atlas that includes genes encoding signaling, adhesion, and transcription factors. Wnt inhibition results in anterior positional information induction and ectopic head formation that is restricted to the DVB. DVB can be transplanted, and DVB identity can be experimentally induced at ectopic locations. Ectopic DVB is competent for anterior positional identity induction following Wnt inhibition, enabling the generation of animals with ectopic heads at experimentally dictated locations. DVB removal blocks the anteriorization that normally follows Wnt inhibition and prevents anterior positional information expression during head regeneration. Anterior positional information induction at the DVB after Wnt inhibition occurs independently from anterior pole formation, which promotes head patterning in regeneration. Our findings reveal a hierarchical model of pattern integration across body axes in which DV patterning is central by producing a DVB with competence to direct formation of large AP axis regions. This mechanism enables coordination of orthogonal positional information in the context of regeneration."

While the benefits of dietary prebiotics are well-known, chemically targeting the gut microbiota to enhance host fitness remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel chemical approach to induce a pro-longevity bacterial metabolite in the host gut. We discovered that wild-type <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains overproduce colanic acids (CAs) when exposed to a low dose of cephaloridine, leading to an increased life span in the host organism <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. In the mouse gut, oral administration of low-dose cephaloridine induced transcription of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (<i>cps</i>) operon responsible for CA biosynthesis in commensal <i>E. coli</i> at 37 \u00b0C, and attenuated age-related metabolic changes.

Subcellular proteomes can be assembled either by the transport of proteins synthesized in the cell soma or by the delivery of mRNAs to target compartments where they are locally translated into proteins. This latter mechanism is known as local protein synthesis or local translation, and it has been best studied in neurons. Increasing evidence suggests it is also required to maintain local protein homeostasis in glial cells; however, in microglia, local translation remains largely unexplored. Given the scant evidence, we aimed at exploring the existence of local translation in peripheral microglial processes (PeMPs) and unraveling its functional significance. We report that local translation indeed happens in PeMPs, and it is enhanced by triggering a microglial inflammatory response with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) suggesting a functional relevance of this molecular mechanism in response to inflammation. We found that <i>Actb</i> mRNA polarizes to PeMPs and is locally translated upon LPS exposure. Interestingly, downregulation of the <i>Actb</i>-binding protein IMP1/ZBP1 impaired <i>Actb</i> mRNA polarization and its localized translation, and led to defects in filopodia distribution, PeMP motility, lamellar directed migration, and phagocytosis in microglia. Thus, our work contributes to recent findings that mRNA localization and localized translation occur in microglia and gives a mechanistic insight into the relevance of this molecular mechanism in fundamental microglial functions in response to inflammation."

A decades-long accumulation of phosphate and oxygen-sapping substances appeared to reduce the efficiency of the lateral supply of oxygen from intrusions and major Baltic inflows via the narrow Baltic Straits. The dynamic change of, in particular, phosphate cycling in deep waters during these inflows contrasts with the sluggish response to river load reduction measures. Seasonal phosphate recycling in surface water results mainly from exchange with the large deep-water phosphate pool, and this key exchange can be better interpreted based on an improved understanding of its physical drivers.</p></div>"

The ecology, diversity, and properties of ammonia-oxidizing microbes in the ocean's plankton have been extensively studied, but these microbes can also live in association or symbiosis with marine hosts such as sponges, corals, jellyfish, bivalves, and crustaceans. Sequencing-based studies have revealed that ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the family Nitrosopumilaceae are prevalent in various marine hosts, although other taxa are also found and coexist within the same host. Ammonia oxidation rates are highly variable between host species, even between closely related taxa. Limited knowledge is available on the metabolic interactions that ammonia-oxidizing microbes have, but theoretical considerations indicate that they could make significant contributions to carbon fixation for their hosts. Additionally, ammonia-oxidizing microbes appear to also have undergone specific genomic adaptations to their host environment, and the hosts may also enable ammonia oxidation to occur in habitats where planktonic counterparts might be limited. This review identifies key knowledge gaps and highlights the need for further research to fully understand the ecological significance of symbiotic ammonia oxidation in marine ecosystems.</p></div>"

During DVM, zooplankton metabolism leads to carbon and nutrient export to mesopelagic depths, where carbon can be sequestered for decades to millennia, while also introducing labile, energy-rich food sources to midwater ecosystems. Three pervasive metabolic pathways allow zooplankton to sequester carbon: fecal pellet egestion, dissolved organic matter excretion, and respiration. Additionally, there are several less well-parameterized sources of DVM transport associated with growth, feeding, reproduction, and mortality. These processes are challenging to measure in situ and difficult to extrapolate from laboratory experiments, making them some of the most poorly constrained factors in assessments and models of the biological pump.

This review provides an overview of past and recent studies of the GS, with a focus on links between the GS, extreme weather events, climate change, and coastal impacts. Examples of those links include a potential slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the GS that could increase coastal flooding, and hurricanes that disrupt the flow of the GS and cause posthurricane coastal sea level rise. A better understanding of the role of the GS in the Earth's system will help in the prediction of future climate change.</p></div>"

Here, we review and synthesize what is currently known about climate forcings on African landscapes, focusing mainly on the last 4 million years. We use information derived from marine sediment archives and data-numerical climate model comparisons and integration. There exists a heterogeneity in pan-African hydroclimate changes, forced by a combination of orbitally paced, low-latitude fluctuations in insolation; polar ice volume changes; tropical sea surface temperature gradients linked to the Walker circulation; and possibly greenhouse gases. Pan-African vegetation changes do not follow the same pattern, which is suggestive of additional influences, such as CO<span class=\"jp-sub\">2</span> and temperature. We caution against reliance on temporal correlations between global or regional climate, environmental changes, and human evolution and briefly proffer some ideas on how pan-African climate trends could help create novel conceptual frameworks to determine the causal mechanisms of associations between climate/habitat change and hominin evolution.</p></div>"

Oysters provide valuable ecosystem services (ES), including habitat provisioning, water filtration, and shoreline protection. Since the 1990s, a global community of science and practice has organized around oyster restoration with the goal of restoring these valuable services. We highlight ES-based approaches throughout the restoration process, consider applications of emerging technologies, and review knowledge gaps about the life histories and ES provisioning of underrepresented species. Climate change will increasingly affect oyster populations, and we assess how restoration practices can adapt to these changes. Considering ES throughout the restoration process supports adaptive management. For a rapidly growing restoration practice, we highlight the importance of early community engagement, long-term monitoring, and adapting actions to local conditions to achieve desired outcomes.</p></div>"

As an Asian medicine and delicacy, they command fabulous prices and are thus overfished, poached, and trafficked. As noncharismatic animals, many are understudied and inadequately protected. Despite presenting a rich diversity of life histories, members of this broad taxonomic group (class Holothuroidea) are often managed simply as &#8220;sea cucumbers&#8221; in fisheries worldwide. One cannot imagine fishes (class Pisces) being given the same universal treatment. Yet this may happen for species of sea cucumber that differ on the same fundamental level as tilapia and tuna. As more sea cucumbers reach an endangered status and wild populations become depleted to the point of collapse, critical questions arise about the relevance of established conservation and governance strategies. This article reviews the main threats faced by exploited sea cucumbers, outlines conservation and governance effectiveness, identifies gaps in knowledge, and explores management and research perspectives in the context of climate change and booming fisheries crime.

By considering the reciprocal relationships between people and the ecosystems within which they are embedded, evidence of humanity's ability to experiment, learn, adapt, innovate, and sustain diverse and resilient social&#8211;ecological relationships emerges. Therefore, recognizing people as inseparable components of marine ecosystems and their millennia of engagement with coastal ocean spaces is critical to both understanding marine ecosystems and devising resilient and equitable ocean policies.</p></div>"

To date, no comprehensive overview and comparison of all the different methodologies and applications of such indexes is available. Here, we list all types of dysbiosis indexes identified in the literature, introduce their methodology, group them into categories, and discuss their potential descriptive and clinical applications as well as their limitations.

    "content": "Recent advances in connectomics, biophysics, and neuronal electrophysiology warrant modeling of neurons with further details in both network interaction and cellular dynamics. Such models may be referred to as ElectroPhysiome, as they incorporate the connectome and individual neuron electrophysiology to simulate neuronal activities. The nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is considered a viable framework for such ElectroPhysiome studies due to advances in connectomics of its somatic nervous system and electrophysiological recordings of neuron responses. In order to achieve a simulated ElectroPhysiome, the set of parameters involved in modeling individual neurons needs to be estimated from electrophysiological recordings. Here, we address this challenge by developing a deep generative estimation method called ElectroPhysiomeGAN (EP-GAN), which, once trained, can instantly generate parameters associated with the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley neuron model (HH-model) for multiple neurons with graded potential response. The method combines generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture with recurrent neural network encoder and can generate an extensive number of parameters (&gt;170) given the neuron\u2019s membrane potential responses and steady-state current profiles. We validate our method by estimating HH-model parameters for 200 simulated neurons with graded membrane potential followed by nine experimentally recorded neurons (where six of them are newly recorded) in the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i>. Comparison of EP-GAN with existing estimation methods shows EP-GAN's advantage in the accuracy of estimated parameters and inference speed for both small and large numbers of parameters being inferred. In addition, the architecture of EP-GAN permits input with arbitrary clamping protocols, allowing inference of parameters even when partial membrane potential and steady-state currents profiles are given as inputs. EP-GAN is designed to leverage the generative capability of GAN to align with the dynamical structure of the HH-model and thus is able to achieve such performance."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/106866",
    "content": "Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) initially show temporally graded retrograde amnesia, which gradually progresses into more severe retrograde amnesia. Although mouse models of AD have provided insight into neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impaired formation and retrieval of new memories, the process underlying the progressive loss of remote memories in AD has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate age-dependent remote memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, which coincides with progressive hyperexcitability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of Fos expression showed that the remote memory deficit is not mirrored by changes in reactivation of memory-encoding neurons, so-called engram cells, nor PV interneuron (re)activation, in the mPFC. However, inhibitory input is enhanced onto engram cells compared to non-engram cells specifically in APP/PS1 mice. Our data indicate that age-dependent remote memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is due to increased innervation of cortical engram cells by hyperexcitable PV interneurons, suggesting that dysfunctional inhibitory microcircuits in the neocortex mediate progressive retrograde amnesia in AD."

    "content": "Astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming via depletion of PTBP1, a potent repressor of neuronal splicing, has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, but its efficacy remains debated. While some reported successful conversion, others disputed this, citing a lack of neuronal gene expression as evidence of failed reprogramming. This interpretation was further challenged, attributed to incomplete PTBP1 inactivation, fueling ongoing controversy. Mechanistic understanding of the conversion, or the lack thereof, requires investigating, in conjunction with lineage tracing, the effect of <i>Ptbp1</i> loss of function in mature astrocytes on RNA splicing, which has not yet been examined. Here, we genetically ablated PTBP1 in adult Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 Ai14 mice to determine whether lineage-traced <i>Ptbp1</i> knockout astrocytes exhibited RNA splicing alterations congruent with neuronal differentiation. We found no widespread induction of neurons, despite a minuscule fraction of knockout cells showing neuron-like transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes induced splicing alterations unlike neuronal splicing patterns. These findings suggest that targeting PTBP1 alone is ineffective to drive neuronal reprogramming and highlight the need for combining splicing and lineage analyses. Loss of astrocytic PTBP1 is insufficient to induce neuronal splicing, contrasting with its well-known role in other non-neuronal cells, and instead affects a distinct astrocytic splicing program."

    "content": "We can now collect cell-count data across whole animal brains quantifying recent neuronal activity, gene expression, or anatomical connectivity. This is a powerful approach since it is a multiregion measurement, but because the imaging is done postmortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive, and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be undersampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We present a \u2018standard\u2019 partially pooled Bayesian model for multiregion cell-count data and apply it to two example datasets. These examples demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data. In both cases, the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel <i>t</i>-tests. Overall, inference for cell-count data is substantially improved by the ability of the Bayesian approach to capture nested data and by its rigorous handling of uncertainty in undersampled data."

    "content": "The calcitonin (CT) family of related peptides exerts diverse physiological effects in mammals via two G-protein-coupled receptors: CTR and the CTR-like receptor CLR. Phylogenetic analysis of CT-type signaling has revealed the presence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in both deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have demonstrated that in the protostome <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> the CT-like peptide DH<sub>31</sub> can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here, we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber <i>Apostichopus japonicus</i> (phylum Echinodermata). In <i>A. japonicus,</i> a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), and both peptides act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, G\u03b1q/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. AjCT1/AjCT2-encoding transcripts were detected in the central nervous system and a variety of organ systems, and neuropeptide expression was visualized immunohistochemically using an antiserum to a starfish CT-type peptide (ArCT). In vitro pharmacological experiments demonstrated that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments, combined with gain- and loss-of-function experiments, revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2/AjPDFR2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in <i>A. japonicus</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome. Moreover, it provides the first evidence for appetite-stimulating and growth-promoting effects of CT-type neuropeptides in bilaterians. Given the economic importance of <i>A. japonicus</i> as a foodstuff, the discovery of CT-type peptides as potential regulators of feeding and growth in this species may offer novel strategies for aquaculture applications."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/104126",
    "content": "In the nervous system, reliable communication depends on the ability of neurons to adaptively remodel their synaptic structure and function in response to changes in neuronal activity. While neurons are the main drivers of synaptic plasticity, glial cells are increasingly recognized for their roles as active modulators. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model system for a tripartite synapse, we show that peripheral glial cells collaborate with neurons at the NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling, in part through a protein called shriveled (Shv). Shv is an activator of integrin signaling previously shown to be released by neurons during intense stimulation at the fly NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We demonstrate that Shv is also present in peripheral glia, and glial Shv is both necessary and sufficient for synaptic remodeling. However, unlike neuronal Shv, glial Shv does not activate integrin signaling at the NMJ. Instead, it regulates synaptic plasticity in two ways: (1) maintaining the extracellular balance of neuronal Shv proteins to regulate integrin signaling, and (2) controlling ambient extracellular glutamate concentration to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance. Loss of glial cells showed the same phenotype as loss of Shv in glia. Together, these results reveal that neurons and glial cells homeostatically regulate extracellular Shv protein levels to control activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Additionally, peripheral glia maintain postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance and contribute to activity-induced synaptic remodeling by regulating ambient glutamate concentration at the fly NMJ."

Given the complete profile of mRNA targets and their editing rate in individual cells is unclear, single-cell RNA transcriptomes obtained by Patch-seq from <i>Drosophila</i> larval glutamatergic motoneuron subtypes were analyzed to determine the most highly edited targets and identify single neuron editing rules. 316 high-confidence A-to-I canonical RNA edit sites were identified, with 60 causing missense amino acid changes predicted to alter proteins regulating membrane excitability, synaptic transmission, or neuronal function. Twenty-seven canonical sites were edited at &gt;90% frequency as observed for editing of mammalian AMPA receptors. However, most sites were edited at lower levels and generated variable expression of edited and unedited mRNAs, suggesting stochastic editing that may provide a mechanism to fine-tune synaptic function similar to alternative splicing. Noncanonical editing was also found to occur in these neurons, including a C-to-U edit that altered an amino acid in the capsid hinge domain of the synaptic plasticity regulator Arc1. Together, these data provide insights into how the RNA editing landscape may alter protein function to modulate the properties of two well-characterized neuronal populations in <i>Drosophila</i>."

    "content": "The thalamocortical pathways exhibit neuroplasticity not only during the critical period but also in adulthood. In this study, we investigated how cholecystokinin (CCK) modulates age-dependent thalamocortical plasticity. Our findings demonstrated that CCK is expressed in thalamocortical neurons and that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamocortical pathway triggers the release of CCK in auditory cortex (ACx), as detected by a CCK sensor. HFS of the medial geniculate body (MGB) induced thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) in wild-type young adult mice. However, knockdown of CCK expression in MGB neurons or blockade of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) in the ACx abolished HFS-induced LTP. Interestingly, this LTP could not be elicited in juvenile (3-week-old) or aged mice (over 18-month-old) due to distinct mechanisms: the absence of CCKBR in juveniles and the inability to release CCK in aged mice. Notably, exogenous administration of CCK into the ACx rescued LTP in aged mice and significantly improved frequency discrimination. These findings highlight the potential of CCK as a therapeutic intervention for ameliorating neuroplasticity deficits associated with thalamocortical connectivity."

This original definition provides a unifying framework making testable predictions at both mechanistic and functional levels. While having diverse mechanistic origins, we propose that traveling waves across spatial and temporal scales subserve a canonical computation at the core of a variety of brain functions, thereby ordering neuronal processing to impose a computational syntax."

Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for neurodevelopmental plasticity and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development."

Although the protein sequences encoded by these exons are highly conserved and can mediate interactions, the neurobiological functions of only a small number have been characterized. To establish a more generalized understanding of their roles in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to remove 45 microexons in zebrafish and assessed larval brain activity, morphology, and behavior. Most mutants had minimal or no phenotypes at this developmental stage. Among previously studied microexons, we uncovered baseline and stimulus-driven phenotypes for two microexons (meA and meB) in <i>ptprd</i> and reduced activity in the telencephalon in the <i>tenm3</i> B<sub>0</sub> isoform. Although mild neural phenotypes were discovered for several microexons that have not been previously characterized, including in <i>ppp6r3</i>, <i>sptan1</i>, <i>dop1a</i>, <i>rapgef2</i>, <i>dctn4</i>, <i>vti1a</i>, and <i>meaf6</i>. This study establishes a general approach for investigating conserved alternative splicing events and prioritizes microexons for downstream analysis."

    "content": "Deep learning tools for behavior analysis have enabled important insights and discoveries in neuroscience. Yet, they often compromise interpretability and generalizability for performance, making quantitative comparisons across datasets difficult. We developed a novel deep learning-based behavior analysis pipeline, Avian Vocalization Network (AVN), for zebra finch learned vocalizations - the most widely studied vocal learning model species. AVN annotates songs with high accuracy, generalizing across multiple animal colonies without re-training, and generates a comprehensive set of interpretable features describing song syntax, timing, and acoustic properties. We use this feature set to compare song phenotypes across research groups and experiments and to predict a bird\u2019s stage in song development. Additionally, we have developed a novel method to measure song imitation that requires no training data for new comparisons and outperforms existing similarity scoring methods in its sensitivity and agreement with expert human judgements. These tools are available through the open-source AVN python package and graphical application, making them accessible to researchers without prior coding experience. Altogether, this behavior analysis toolkit stands to accelerate the study of vocal behavior by standardizing phenotype and learning outcome mapping, thus helping scientists better link behavior to the underlying neural processes."

    "content": "This study investigates the computational potential of single striatal projection neurons (SPNs), emphasizing dendritic nonlinearities and their crucial role in solving complex integration problems. Utilizing a biophysically detailed multicompartmental model of an SPN, we introduce a calcium-based, local synaptic learning rule dependent on dendritic plateau potentials. According to what is known about excitatory corticostriatal synapses, the learning rule is governed by local calcium dynamics from NMDA and L-type calcium channels and dopaminergic reward signals. In order to devise a self-adjusting learning rule, which ensures stability for individual synaptic weights, metaplasticity is also used. We demonstrate that this rule allows single neurons with sufficiently nonlinear dendrites to solve the nonlinear feature binding problem, a task traditionally attributed to neuronal networks. We also detail an inhibitory plasticity mechanism that contributes to dendritic compartmentalization, further enhancing computational efficiency in dendrites. This in silico study highlights the computational potential of single neurons, providing deeper insights into neuronal information processing and the mechanisms by which the brain executes complex computations."

Using data from over 11,000 children (ages 9\u201310) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied multivariate models to predict cognitive abilities from mental health, neuroimaging, PGS, and environmental factors. Neuroimaging included 45 MRI-derived features (e.g. task/resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, diffusion imaging). Environmental factors encompassed socio-demographics (e.g. parental income/education), lifestyle (e.g. sleep, extracurricular activities), and developmental adverse events (e.g. parental use of alcohol/tobacco, pregnancy complications). Cognitive abilities were predicted by mental health (r = 0.36), neuroimaging (r = 0.54), PGS (r = 0.25), and environmental factors (r = 0.49). Commonality analyses showed that neuroimaging (66%) and PGS (21%) explained most of the cognitive\u2013mental health link. Environmental factors accounted for 63% of the cognitive\u2013mental health link, with neuroimaging and PGS explaining 58% and 21% of this environmental contribution, respectively. These patterns remained consistent over two years. Findings highlight the importance of neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities in understanding the cognitive\u2013mental health connection and its overlap with environmental factors."

The Mexican tetra, <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, provides a powerful model to study the evolution and consequences of sleep loss. Multiple cave-adapted populations of this species have independently evolved reduced sleep compared to surface populations, yet show no obvious decline in healthspan or longevity. To examine whether evolved sleep loss is associated with DNA damage, we compared DNA damage response (DDR) and oxidative stress across populations. Cavefish exhibited elevated \u03b3H2AX in the brain and increased gut oxidative stress, consistent with chronic sleep deprivation. Following acute UV exposure, surface fish, but not cavefish, increased sleep and activated the photoreactivation repair pathway. Fibroblast cell lines derived from both populations confirmed diminished DDR and repair in cavefish, supporting an attenuated acute DNA damage response. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many genes differentially expressed with aging in surface fish remain unchanged in cavefish, suggesting altered regulation of aging-related pathways. Together, these findings indicate that cavefish experience elevated cellular hallmarks of sleep deprivation yet exhibit resilience to its long-term consequences, highlighting an evolutionary model to investigate the mechanisms underlying sleep, DNA repair, and healthy aging."

Participants (<i>n</i>=20) undergoing fMRI read two-sentence vignettes that elicited implicit causal inferences across sentences, either about the emergence of illness or about the mechanical breakdown of inanimate objects, in addition to noncausal control vignettes. All vignettes were about people and were linguistically matched. The same participants performed localizer tasks: language, logical reasoning, and mentalizing. Inferring illness causes, relative to all control conditions, selectively engaged a portion of the precuneus (PC) previously implicated in the semantic representation of animates (e.g. people, animals). Neural responses to causal inferences about illness were adjacent to but distinct from responses to mental state inferences, suggesting a neural mind/body distinction. We failed to find evidence for domain-general responses to causal inference. Causal inference is supported by content-specific semantic networks that encode causal knowledge."

    "content": "Insects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. Here, we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in <i>Drosophila</i>. The <i>Drosophila ITP</i> gene can generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. We comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa-producing neurons are activated and release ITPa during dehydration. Furthermore, recombinant <i>Drosophila</i> ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach, an ex vivo secretion assay and a heterologous mammalian cell-based assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as a bona fide <i>Drosophila</i> ITPa receptor. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis, and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with <i>ITP</i> knockdown and ITPa overexpression in ITPa-producing neurons. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify pathways via which ITP neurons integrate hygrosensory inputs and interact with other homeostatic hormonal pathways. Taken together, our systematic characterization of ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i>."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/101071",
    "content": "To better understand cognitive processes, it is valuable to consider both periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic electrophysiological brain activity. The aim of this study was to clarify how the periodic and aperiodic electrophysiological components reflect the cognitive processes involved in working memory. Fifty-seven human participants performed an n-back task while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The analysis of both components of the EEG spectrum during task performance indicates that both periodic and aperiodic activities exhibit distinct task-related spatiotemporal dynamics that are closely related to cognitive demands. The results suggest that a substantial portion of the changes often attributed to theta oscillations in working memory tasks may be influenced by shifts in the spectral slope of aperiodic activity. This finding indicates that the modulation of aperiodic activity, associated with cognitive control processes, could provide a more sensitive index of cognitive state changes than previously recognised. To further confirm our findings, we also used these analysis methods in an item-recognition task, which showed similar patterns of periodic and aperiodic activity. These observations challenge the conventional understanding of low-frequency oscillations in cognitive processing and raise concerns about the routine practice of EEG baseline correction in time-frequency analysis, as it may obscure significant modulations in continuous working memory tasks. Consequently, the inclusion of aperiodic activity as a fundamental component of EEG analysis is likely to be critical for the accurate representation of the neural basis of cognition."

    "content": "The nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-S) and its projections to the ventral pallidum (VP) are thought to be critical for stimulus-based decisions. The NAc-S is predominantly composed of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that express either the dopamine D1 (D1-SPNs) or the dopamine D2 receptor (D2-SPNs). Yet, the role of these two neuronal subpopulations and their inputs to the VP in stimulus-based decisions remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics in female and male knock-in rats to selectively silence D1- or D2-SPNs and their projections to the VP at a time when the rats were required to use predictive stimuli to choose between two instrumental actions. Silencing either population of NAc-S SPNs disrupted choice. Silencing NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals in the VP also disrupted choice. However, choice was left intact by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals in the VP. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms and circuitry underlying stimulus-based decisions. We discuss how these insights are consistent with a recent model proposing that these decisions are controlled by an opioid-based memory system residing in the NAc-S."

    "content": "It is unknown how the brain orchestrates coordination of global neural and vascular dynamics. We sought to uncover the role of a sparse but unusual population of genetically distinct interneurons known as type-I nNOS neurons, using a novel pharmacological strategy to unilaterally ablate these neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. Region-specific ablation produced changes in both neural activity and vascular dynamics, decreased power in the delta-band of the local field potential, reduced sustained vascular responses to prolonged sensory stimulation, and abolished the post-stimulus undershoot in cerebral blood volume. Coherence between the left and right somatosensory cortex gamma-band power envelope and blood volume at ultra-low frequencies was decreased, suggesting type-1 nNOS neurons integrate long-range coordination of brain signals. Lastly, we observed decreases in the amplitude of resting-state blood volume oscillations and decreased vasomotion following the ablation of type-I nNOS neurons. This demonstrates that a small population of nNOS-positive neurons is indispensable for regulating both neural and vascular dynamics in the whole brain, raising the possibility that loss of these neurons could contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disturbances."

    "content": "Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu Wilson, 2000, for a review Gherardi et al., 2012). Here, we show the exception to this rule in a non-social arthropod species, the jumping spider <i>Phidippus regius</i>. Using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the \u2018interest\u2019 of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders\u2019 identities. These results suggest that <i>P. regius</i> is capable of individual recognition based on long-term memory."

    "content": "Spatially clustered synaptic inputs enable local dendritic computations important for learning, memory, and sensory processing. In the mammalian visual system, individual retinal ganglion cell axons form clustered terminal boutons containing multiple active zones onto relay cell dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This mature architecture arises through the addition of release sites, which strengthens selected afferents while weaker inputs are pruned. Following eye-opening, spontaneous activity and visual experience promote synaptic refinement and bouton clustering after binocular inputs have segregated. However, anatomical changes in release site addition and spatial patterning during earlier stages of eye-specific competition are not well understood. To investigate this, we examined the spatial organization of eye-specific active zones in wild-type mice and a mutant line with disrupted cholinergic retinal waves. Using volumetric super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy and electron microscopy, we found that individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week. Both eyes generate these \u2018multi-active-zone\u2019 (mAZ) inputs throughout refinement, but the dominant eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts, each with more active zones and larger vesicle pools. At the height of competition (postnatal day 4), the non-dominant-eye projection adds many single-active-zone synapses. Mutants with abnormal cholinergic retinal waves still form mAZ inputs but develop fewer synapses overall and show reduced synaptic clustering in projections from both eyes. Together, these findings reveal eye-specific differences in release site addition that correlate with axonal segregation outcomes during retinogeniculate refinement."

    "content": "It has been suggested that the visual system samples attended information rhythmically. Does rhythmic sampling also apply to distracting information? How do attended information and distracting information compete temporally for neural representations? We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from participants who detected instances of coherent motion in a random-dot kinematogram (RDK; the target), overlayed on different categories (pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant) of affective images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (the distractor). The moving dots were flickered at 4.29 Hz, whereas the IAPS pictures were flickered at 6 Hz. The time course of EEG spectral power at 4.29 Hz was taken to index the temporal dynamics of target processing. The spatial pattern of the EEG spectral power at 6 Hz was similarly extracted and subjected to a moving-window MVPA decoding analysis to index the temporal dynamics of processing pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant distractor pictures. We found that (1) both target processing and distractor processing exhibited rhythmicity at ~1 Hz and (2) the phase difference between the two rhythmic time courses was related to task performance, i.e., relative phase closer to \u03c0 predicted a higher rate of coherent motion detection whereas relative phase closer to 0 predicted a lower rate of coherent motion detection. These results suggest that (1) in a target-distractor scenario, both attended and distracting information were sampled rhythmically and (2) the more target sampling and distractor sampling were separated in time within a sampling cycle, the less distraction effects were observed, both at the neural and the behavioral level."

    "content": "While traditionally considered a motor structure, the cerebellum is also involved in cognition. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms through which the cerebellum contributes to evolutionarily novel cognitive abilities remain poorly understood. Another open question is how this structure contributes to a core unifying mechanism across domains. Motivated by the evolutionary principle of neural reuse, we suggest that a successful account of cerebellar contributions to higher cognitive domains will build on the structure\u2019s established role in motor behaviors. We conducted a series of neuropsychological experiments, assessing selective impairments in participants with cerebellar ataxia (CA) compared to neurotypicals in solving sequential discrete problems. In three experiments, participants were asked to solve symbolic subtraction, alphabet letter transformation, and novel artificial grammar problems, which were expected or unexpected. The CA group exhibited a disproportionate cost when comparing unexpected problems to expected problems, suggesting that the cerebellum is critical for violation of expectations (VE) across tasks. The CA group impairment was not found either when the complexity of the problem increased or in conditions of uncertainty. Together, these results demonstrate a possible causal role for the human cerebellum in higher cognitive abilities. VE might be a unifying cerebellar-dependent mechanism across motor and cognitive domains."

    "content": "Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging imaging modality that resolves microvasculature in deep tissues with high spatial resolution. However, existing preclinical ULM applications are largely constrained to anesthetized animals, introducing confounding vascular effects such as vasodilation and altered hemodynamics. As such, ULM quantifications (e.g., vessel diameter, density, and flow velocity) may be confounded by the use of anesthesia, undermining the usefulness of ULM in practice. Here, we introduce a method to address this limitation and achieve ULM imaging in awake mouse brain. Pupillary monitoring was used to support the presence of the awake state during ULM imaging. Vasodilation induced by isoflurane was observed by ULM. Upon recovery to the awake state, reductions in vessel density and flow velocity were observed across different brain regions. In the cortex, the effects induced by isoflurane are more pronounced on venous flow than on arterial flow. In addition, serial in vivo imaging of the same animal brain at weekly intervals demonstrated the highly robust longitudinal imaging capability of the proposed technique. The consistency was further verified through quantitative analysis on individual vessels, cortical regions of arteries and veins, and subcortical regions. This study demonstrates longitudinal ULM imaging in the awake mouse brain, which is crucial for many ULM brain applications that require awake and behaving animals."

    "content": "Numerous studies advocate for a rhythmic mode of perception. However, the evidence in the context of hearing remains inconsistent. We propose that the divergent conclusions drawn from previous work stem from conceptual and methodological issues. These include ambiguous assumptions regarding the origin of rhythmicity, variations in tasks and attentional demands, and differing analytical approaches for statistical testing. To address these points, we conducted a series of experiments in which human participants performed auditory tasks involving monaural targets presented against binaural white noise backgrounds, while also recording eye movements. These experiments varied in whether stimuli were presented randomly or required motor initialisation, the necessity of memory across trials, and the manipulation of attentional demands. Our findings challenge the notion of universal rhythmicity in hearing, but support the existence of paradigm- and ear-specific fluctuations in sensitivity and biases at multiple frequencies. The rhythmicity for sounds in the left and right ears appears independent among participants, and the rhythmicity in performance is possibly linked to oculomotor activity and attentional requirements. Overall, these results may help to resolve conflicting conclusions drawn in previous work and provide specific avenues for further studies into the rhythmicity of auditory perception."

Despite recent progress in multisensory research, the absence of stimulus-computable perceptual models fundamentally limits our understanding of how the brain extracts and combines task-relevant cues from the continuous flow of natural multisensory stimuli. Here, we introduce an image- and sound-computable population model for audiovisual perception, based on biologically plausible units that detect spatiotemporal correlations across auditory and visual streams. In a large-scale simulation spanning 69 psychophysical, eye-tracking, and pharmacological experiments, our model replicates human, monkey, and rat behaviour in response to diverse audiovisual stimuli with an average correlation exceeding 0.97. Despite relying on as few as 0\u20134 free parameters, our model provides an end-to-end account of audiovisual integration in mammals\u2014from individual pixels and audio samples to behavioural responses. Remarkably, the population response to natural audiovisual scenes generates saliency maps that predict spontaneous gaze direction, Bayesian causal inference, and a variety of previously reported multisensory illusions. This study demonstrates that the integration of audiovisual stimuli, regardless of their spatiotemporal complexity, can be accounted for in terms of elementary joint analyses of luminance and sound level. Beyond advancing our understanding of the computational principles underlying multisensory integration in mammals, this model provides a bio-inspired, general-purpose solution for multimodal machine perception."

Here, we searched metagenomic data from hydrothermally impacted deep sea sediments in the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) for PETases. A broad diversity of potential proteins were identified and 22 were selected based on their potential thermal stability and phylogenetic novelty. Heterologous expression and functional analysis of these candidate PETases revealed three candidates capable of depolymerizing PET or its byproducts. One is a PETase from a Bathyarchaeia archaeon (dubbed GuaPA, for Guaymas PETase Archaeal) and two bishydroxyethylene terephthalate-hydrolyzing enzymes (BHETases) from uncultured bacteria, Poribacteria, and Thermotogota. GuaPA is the first archaeal PETase discovered that is able to depolymerize PET films and originates from a specific enzyme class which has endowed it with predicted novel structural features. Within 48\u00a0h, GuaPA released ~3\u20135\u00a0mM of terephthalic acid and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate from low crystallinity PET. PET co-hydrolysis containing GuaPA and one of the newly discovered BHETases further improves the hydrolysis of untreated PET film by 68%. Genomic analysis of the PETase- and BHETase-encoding microorganisms reveals that they likely metabolize the products of enzymatic PET depolymerization, suggesting an ecological role in utilizing anthropogenic carbon sources. Our analysis reveals a previously uncharacterized ability of these uncultured microorganisms to catabolize PET, suggesting that the deep ocean is a potential reservoir of biocatalysts for the depolymerization of plastic waste.</span>"

Indoleacetic acid activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, leading to upregulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, a detoxification enzyme essential for chlorantraniliprole resistance, as confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. This tripartite EMBL-3\u2013indoleacetic acid\u2013UDP-glucuronosyltransferase axis defines a hierarchical symbiont-host metabolic network driving chlorantraniliprole resistance.

Understanding how such functions arise from individual species and their interactions remains a major challenge, limiting efforts to rationally understand microbial roles in both natural and engineered ecosystems. Because current holistic (meta-omics) and reductionist (isolation- or single-cell-based) approaches struggle to capture these emergent microbial community functions, this study explores an intermediate strategy: analyzing simple subcommunity combinations to enable a bottom-up understanding of community-level functions. To examine the validity of this approach, we used a nine-member synthetic microbial community capable of degrading the environmental pollutant aniline, and systematically generated a dataset of 256 subcommunity combinations and their associated functions. Analyses using random forest models revealed that the subcommunity combinations of just three to four species enabled the quantitative prediction of functions in larger communities (5\u20139-member; Pearson\u2019s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">r</span>\u2009=\u20090.78\u20130.80).

Moreover, interpreting models trained on these simple subcommunity combinations enabled the identification of key species and interspecies interactions that strongly influence the overall community function.

Hosts exert controls on the composition and function of their internally associated symbionts, but an underappreciated modality of microbiome curation is external to the host through changes to the environmental species pool from which they recruit microbial symbionts. Niche construction theory describes how organisms alter their environment and the selective landscape of their offspring and conspecifics. We hypothesize that host-driven manipulation of environmental microbial communities is an underexplored form of this concept. Using the pitcher plant mosquito (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wyeomyia smithii</span>) as a model, we tested how hosts shape microbial communities across developmental stages and gradients of pre-existing community complexity. We report three lines of evidence supporting host-mediated niche construction, leveraging amplicon sequencing and microbiota manipulation experiments with germ-free (axenic) and selectively recolonized (gnotobiotic) mosquitoes. First, single female egg-laying assays showed repeatable adult inoculation of sterile water with beneficial bacteria capable of sustaining robust larval development. Second, increasing larval density in assays inoculated with complex, field-derived microbial communities selected for environmental and host-associated bacteria that correlated with increased larval fitness. Finally, exposing axenic larvae to mixtures of parentally and environmentally derived microbiota demonstrated that prior conditioning by conspecifics enhanced offspring fitness.

Species area relationships are resoundingly positive across macrobes such as plants and animals, and emerge through nonexclusive stochastic and deterministic processes including changes in immigration and extinction, drift, and environmental heterogeneity. Due to unique attributes of the microbial lifestyle, they may not abide by similar rules as macrobes, especially when it comes to spatial scaling. We predict that host-associated microbiomes will exhibit shallower species area relationships than free-living microbiomes due to strong host filtering, and that the species area relationships of bacteria will be shallower than fungi due primarily to differences in dispersal ability. We test these predictions in a relatively simple field system where bromeliad phytotelmata comprise aquatic ecosystems that support invertebrates and environmental substrates such as detritus. Larger phytotelmata generate larger habitat islands for microbiomes allowing us to explicitly examine their species area relationships. We find that the species area relationships of free-living and host-associated microbiomes differ, as do those of microbiome members. By assessing the relationship between environmental conditions and richness, and measuring diversity across scales, we posit that these observed differences in species area relationships are owed to differences in realized niches and dispersal abilities among microbes. These findings highlight that the classic laws of biological spatial scaling do not necessarily accurately represent microbiomes, and that the influence of area on diversity appears to be more important for some microbiomes and microbes than others.</span>"

In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and metabolomics were applied to examine how three thermal recovery regimes\u2014constant temperature, gradual warming, and cold-dark preconditioning\u2014shape microbial succession and dissolved organic matter dynamics. Constant temperature accelerated the dispersal limitation of bacterial communities and promoted rapid dissolved organic matter (DOM) turnover, whereas gradual warming and cold-dark preconditioning induced more undominated community structures, and the accumulation of nitrogen- and sulfur-rich DOM compounds. Cold-dark pretreatment notably enhanced the formation of structurally complex, recalcitrant DOM, and delayed microbial reactivation. The network of relationships between microorganisms and dissolved organic matter revealed distinct coupling patterns across treatments, with enhanced microbial processing of aromatic and humic-like molecules occurring under thermal fluctuation or stress. Metabolomic profiling further indicated different physiological adaptation strategies, with stress-linked metabolites enriched under variable-temperature conditions.

Here, we quantify the extent of research on known microbial eukaryotic species. Nearly half of the mentions of protist species on publications in PubMed referenced only 10 species included in the Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR2) Database. Likewise, although most samples in the PR2 database are free-living protists from aquatic environments, 12 species of human parasites comprise 47% of the literature. Research efforts that focus on only a handful of eukaryotic lineages severely limit our understanding of the fundamental biology of eukaryotic cells. We highlight recent efforts to characterize novel eukaryotic lineages that have resulted in a new understanding of the rules of life and identify key lineages that are notably absent or limited in the literature, despite their abundance and significance across global ecosystems.</span>"

In soil, the spread of antibiotics and resistant microbes, and thereby antimicrobial resistance (AMR), can accelerate because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Here we propose that the dual production and release of antimicrobial compounds to the environment, and the increase in global temperatures as a consequence of climate change, will have synergistic effects leading to both enhanced climate change and disease risk. We predict that an increase in AMR will reduce microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) because interactions amongst microbes will lead to the allocation of available resources towards AMR and metabolism instead of growth. This reduction in CUE may lead to increased greenhouse gas release; however, the extent to which AMR can affect the stability of soil carbon by altering microbial CUE remains unknown. This concern is especially pertinent in the Arctic, which is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth and contains substantial soil carbon reservoirs.</span>"

All the consortia showed a broad spectrum of TerrOC utilization, and displayed degradation capacities comparable with those previously established though preliminary in situ lignocellulose enrichment. Moreover, following the metabolic theory of ecology, annual average temperature of the sites stimulated community metabolism, even though all were cultured at 30\u00b0C. Consortia enriched on aspen exhibited the highest temperature sensitivity. 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metatranscriptomic sequencing analyses revealed temperature-dependent latitudinal diversity gradients, displaying a trend that was opposite of the temperature-diversity positive relationship observed in terrestrial lignin-degrading microbes. The community composition shifted to adapt to rising environmental temperature. To enhance lignin degradation, aspen consortia from high annual average temperature employed metabolic generalists, which induced expression of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">dypB</span> centered gene families for lignin depolymerization and versatile pathways for degradation of lignin derivates.

We have demonstrated that gut microbial communities transform a broad spectrum of environmental pollutants through evolutionarily conserved pathways, fundamentally altering their bioavailability, fate, and toxicity potential within the host. Transformation reactions are elucidated with connections among the metabolic enzymes that are developed by specific gut microbes, emphasizing the markedly specific and complementary signatures of microbial biotransformation compared to the host process. By integrating multidisciplinary studies, the complex and dynamic interplay between the gut microbiota, host physiology, and environmental pollutants has been elucidated, and drivers involved in the biotransformation processes have been proposed. Furthermore, current methodologies are critically evaluated, and next-generation approaches to reveal the underlying mechanisms of gut microbiota-driven pollutant transformation are outlined.

This was true across eight different environments with either simple carbon sources (e.g. glucose) and more complex ones (e.g. glycogen).

We integrated species-level microbial analyses of biofilm, sediment, and sewer wastewater in domestic gravity and pressure sewers in Aalborg, Denmark, with samples from influent wastewater and activated sludge from two downstream wastewater treatment plants. By tracing the sources of incoming bacteria and determining their growth fate in the activated sludge, we confirmed that most activated sludge process-critical bacteria were part of the sewer microbiome. Within the sewer system, a gradient was observed, from dominance of gut bacteria in the wastewater upstream to the prevalence of biofilm and sediment bacteria downstream at the wastewater treatment plant inlet, with the relative ratio strongly affected by rain events. A holistic understanding of the sewer system and activated sludge is essential, as sewers hold massive amounts of active biomass serving as a major microbial source for community composition and dynamics in wastewater treatment plants. Sewer systems should be recognized as a crucial environmental filtration step, and the sewer microbiome as an important source for activated sludge, helping to explain the observed regional and global differences in activated sludge community structure.</span>"

By integrating genetic manipulation, transcriptomic analysis, biochemical assays, and live-cell tracking microscopy at the single-cell level, we present a novel predation strategy mediated by peptidoglycan hydrolase LssL, named peptidoglycan hydrolase-driven Prey Localization and Utilization System (phPLUS). In phPLUS, predators secrete LssL to initiate the Step I of the localization process. LssL then hydrolyzes prey and releases small molecules of glycine, which serve as signaling cues to guide the predator\u2019s directional movement and promote the Step II of localization. In turn, prey signals upregulate the expression of LssL, which synergize with type VI secretion system to ultimately mediate prey killing through a novel regulatory pathway.

The dCache_1- and GAPES1-type receptors can function as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, histidine kinases, c-di-GMP synthases and/or c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, serine phosphatases, and serine/threonine kinases, suggesting the diversity of AI-2-mediated interspecies communication modes among human gut microbiota. Metatranscriptomic analysis showed that a number of AI-2 synthase- and receptor-encoding genes can be expressed in the human gut in healthy and/or unhealthy states. The communication network analysis suggests that AI-2-mediated interactions widely occur among members of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Firmicutes</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Proteobacteria</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Actinobacteriota</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Campylobacterota</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Spirochaetota</span>.

Transcription profiles were significantly different between planktonic and biofilm growth in all strains, and revealed individual transcriptomic responses, albeit fulfilling shared functions. In particular, the strong expression of different types of multicopper oxidases was observed in all strains suggesting modifications of their cell coats. S-layer carrying AOA each additionally expressed a set of adhesion proteins supporting attachment. Detoxification of nitrous compounds, copper acquisition as well as the expression of transcription factor B were also shared responses among biofilm producing strains. However, the majority of differentially expressed protein families was distinct among the three strains, illustrating that individual solutions have evolved for the shared growth mode of biofilm formation in AOA, probably driven by the different ecological niches.</span>"

Despite its importance, lateral gene transfer quantification in nature using traditional phylogenetic methods has been hampered by the rarity of most genes within the enormous microbial pangenomes. Here, we estimated lateral gene transfer rates within the epipelagic tropical and subtropical ocean using a global, randomized collection of single amplified genomes and a non-phylogenetic computational approach. By comparing the fraction of shared genes between pairs of genomes against a lateral gene transfer-free model, we show that an average cell line laterally acquires and retains ~13% of its genes every 1 million years. This translates to a net lateral gene transfer rate of ~250 genes L<sup>\u22121</sup> seawater day<sup>\u22121</sup> and involves both \u201cflexible\u201d and \u201ccore\u201d genes.

Both partners are photosynthetic, yet how the partners acquire, share, or compete for bicarbonate necessary for their photosynthesis is unknown.

This study analyzed the seasonal dynamics of gut microbiota in giant pandas (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ailuropoda melanoleuca</span>), Asian black bears (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ursus thibetanus</span>), brown bears (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ursus arctos</span>), and polar bears (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ursus maritimus</span>), and combined with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, revealed the following findings.

Finally, despite feeding on bamboo, giant pandas microbiota driven energy metabolism pathways (such as SCFAs) are highly conserved compared to other bears, suggesting a deep commonality in the adaptability of bear microbiota in evolution. Therefore, this study challenges the traditional view of microbial uniqueness of giant pandas, and emphasizes the co-evolutionary mechanism of energy metabolism adaptation in bear animals through microbial plasticity.

Using a novel stepped-sackhole method, we collected sea-ice brines from distinct horizons of an Arctic ice floe, capturing microbial communities that had been exposed to different environmental conditions. Through Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we characterized methylation patterns in bacterial and associated viral DNA, analysing for methylation motifs and differences between ice horizons. We identified 22 unique bacterial methylation motifs and 27 viral motifs across three nucleotide methylation types (5mC, 6\u00a0mA, and 4mC), with evidence of differential methylation between upper and lower ice.

Video microscopy of motile filaments in a microchamber slide setup revealed that some filaments did not fully bridge the gap between the sulfidic and oxic zone, but made transient contact with each other. Contacts were always end-to-end and often occurred repeatedly, in which filaments always followed the same trajectory back and forth.

Methane production in wetlands is the final step of carbon decomposition performed by anaerobic archaea. Although hydrogen/carbon dioxide and acetate are the substrates most often attributed to methanogenesis, other substrates\u2014such as methylated compounds\u2014may additionally play important roles in driving methane production in wetland systems. Here we conducted mesocosm experiments combined with genome-resolved metatranscriptomics to investigate the impact of diverse methanogenic substrate amendment on methanogenesis in two high methane-emitting wetlands with distinct geochemistry, termed P7 and P8. Methanol amendment resulted in high methane production at both sites, whereas acetate and formate amendment only stimulated methanogenesis in P7 mesocosms, where aqueous sulfide concentrations were lower. In P7 sediments, formate amendment fueled acetogenic microbes that produced acetate, which was subsequently utilized by acetoclastic methanogens. In contrast to expression profiles in P7 mesocosms, active methylotrophic methanogen genomes from P8 showed increased expression of genes related to membrane remodeling and DNA damage repair, indicative of stress tolerance mechanisms to counter sulfide toxicity. Methylotrophic methanogenesis generates higher free energy yields than acetoclastic methanogenesis, which likely enables allocation of more energy toward stress responses. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature highlighting methylotrophic methanogenesis as an important methane production pathway in wetlands. By using less competitive substrates like methanol that provide greater energy yields, methylotrophic methanogens may invest in physiological strategies that provide competitive advantages across a range of environmental stresses.</span>"

This pathway may play a role in the long-term establishment and evolution of stable bacteria-host interactions across plant generations. Hundreds of seed-bacteria associations have been recently uncovered; however, most seem to be transient or unspecific. Although it is known that microorganisms can be transmitted from plant tissues to seeds and from seeds to seedlings, the experimental confirmation of bacterial transfer through successive plant generations by inoculation remains unreported. In this study, we identified <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pantoea</span> as the unique core endophytic bacteria inhabiting the endosperms of 24 wheat seed samples originally harvested in different worldwide locations. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pantoea</span> is the genus with the highest relative average abundance in wheat seeds (61%) and in germinated roots and shoots grown under gnotobiotic conditions (45\u201338%). In the field, it was the only genus dwelling roots, shoots, spikes, and seeds of four different wheat varieties tested and its abundance progressively increased across these tissues. This genuine pattern of vertical enrichment, which was not found in other common wheat-associated taxa, suggests a role in the transfer of these endophytic bacteria through the seeds. To confirm intergenerational transmission, parental plants were inoculated with labelled <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pantoea</span> isolates, which specifically colonized the next generations of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Poaceae</span> plants, experimentally demonstrating bacterial vertical inheritance to the offspring generations and suggesting transmission specificity.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Microbial communities experience environmental fluctuations across timescales from rapid changes in moisture, temperature, or light levels to long-term seasonal or climactic variations. Understanding how microbial populations respond to these changes is critical for predicting the impact of perturbations, interventions, and climate change on communities. Because communities typically harbor tens to hundreds of distinct taxa, the response of microbial abundances to perturbations is potentially complex. However, even though taxonomic diversity is high, in many communities taxa can be grouped into metabolic guilds of strains with similar metabolic traits. These guilds effectively reduce the complexity of the system by providing a physiologically motivated coarse-graining. Here, using a combination of simulations, theory, and experiments, we show that the response of guilds to nutrient fluctuations depends on the timescale of those fluctuations. Rapid changes in nutrient levels drive cohesive, positively correlated abundance dynamics within guilds. For slower timescales of environmental variation, members within a guild begin to compete due to similar resource preferences, driving negative correlations in abundances between members of the same guild. Our results provide a route to understanding the relationship between metabolic guilds and community response to changing environments, as well as an experimental approach to discovering metabolic guilds via designed nutrient perturbations to communities.</span>"

Effective strategies are urgently needed to mitigate ARG spread in agricultural settings. Biochar, an eco-friendly soil amendment, shows promise for pollution control, yet its role in suppressing ARG horizontal gene transfer remains unclear. Here, metagenomic analysis showed that manure application significantly increased the relative abundance of ARGs in soil microbiota, whereas biochar amendment reduced it. To determine whether biochar suppresses ARG dissemination by inhibiting horizontal transfer, we established a soil microcosm. Manure application increased the conjugative transfer ratio by 3-fold, whereas biochar effectively suppressed this transfer\u2014reducing it to levels observed in unamended soils. Cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing demonstrated that biochar treatment reduced the diversity of transconjugant pools at both phylum and genus levels. Transconjugants were primarily affiliated with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonadota</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bacillota</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Actinomycetota</span>, with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Massilia</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Delftia</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ammoniphilus</span> being the most abundant genera in biochar treatment soil. Mechanistic investigations revealed that biochar-mediated inhibition of ARG transfer was linked to reduced ATP energy supply, decreased reactive oxygen species production, and lower cell membrane permeability, and diminished bioavailability of heavy metals and antibiotics. Additionally, biochar altered soil enzyme activity and microbial community structure, further limiting ARG dissemination. The findings provide insights into biochar-induced mitigation of ARG spread in manure-amended soils and highlight its potential as an effective strategy for controlling environmental ARG transmission.</span>"

Yet, studying these interactions is challenging due to difficulties in resolving spatiotemporal scales, quantifying interaction strengths, and integrating intrinsic cellular behaviors with extrinsic environmental conditions. Individual-based modeling addresses these challenges through single-cell-level simulations that explicitly model growth, division, motility, and environmental responses. By capturing both the spatial organization and social interactions, individual-based modeling reveals how microbial interactions and environmental gradients collectively shape community architecture, species coexistence, and adaptive responses. In particular, individual-based modeling provides mechanistic insights into how social behaviors\u2014such as competition, metabolic cooperation, and quorum sensing\u2014are regulated by spatial structure, uncovering the interplay between localized interactions and emergent community properties. In this review, we synthesize recent applications of individual-based modeling in studying bacterial spatial and social interactions, highlighting how their interplay governs community stability, diversity, and resilience. By linking individual-scale interactions with the ecosystem-level organization, individual-based modeling offers a predictive framework for understanding microbial ecology and informing strategies for controlling and engineering bacterial consortia in both natural and applied settings.</span>"

Although their calcitic shells are preserved in oceanic sediments over millennia, their resilience in the future decades is uncertain. We review current literature describing the response of calcifying protists to ocean acidification and temperature warming. We examine these key ecological and biogeochemical processes through the cellular perspective, exploring the physiological, metabolic, and molecular responses of calcifying protists. Ocean acidification is a chemical process that takes place in the seawater outside the cell, whereas protists calcify inside a modified cellular microenvironment. The function of these calcification compartments depends on cellular response to ocean acidification, such as maintaining pH homeostasis. The response of calcifying protists to ocean acidification and temperature warming is species-specific, with no unifying trends but rather a range of sensitivity levels. Coccolithophores and foraminifera display physiological sensitivity that may hamper their ecological success in comparison to noncalcifying species. Yet, certain species may be more adaptable, especially when comparing to highly vulnerable calcifying molluscs as pteropods. As the molecular machinery mediating cellular calcification is not fully resolved, as well as the functional role of the calcitic shell, our ability to predict the fate of calcifying microorganisms in a warmer, more acidic ocean is limited. We propose the urgent need to expand the study of these model systems by advancing cell biology approaches and better understand the impact of climate change on microbial food webs in the ocean.</span>"

We found that in a screen of 150 natural isolates, almost a third were auxotrophs for one or more B vitamins. By measuring physiological parameters such as uptake affinities and comparing those to ambient seawater concentrations, we showed that marine bacteria live at the edge of vitamin limitation in the environment. To understand how auxotrophs survive in the open oceans, we used our experimental data to model vitamin cross-feeding on particles through both secretion and lysis.

Often, these bacteria are hosted extracellularly within structures on the leaves, where they produce specialized bioactive metabolites that benefit their host. These associations are highly specific, with one plant species associating with a single bacterial species, but little is known about how these symbioses originate and how specificity is maintained. In this study, we show that the symbiotic association between a wild yam and a bacterium can be manipulated experimentally and that bacteria-free plants are open to colonization by environmental bacteria. Through metabolic profiling, we show that the endophytic niche is rich in organic acids and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle cycle. Environmental bacteria capable of utilizing these acids, such as the soil bacterium <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas putida</span>, readily colonize aposymbiotic plants. However, successful colonization is contingent upon the absence of the vertically transmitted symbiont or the impairment of its type VI secretion system. Unexpectedly for a vertically transmitted symbiosis, these findings suggest that microbe\u2013microbe interactions, including antagonism, may play a crucial role in maintaining the specificity of an association. However, low transmission rates of synthetic symbionts provide evidence that transmission barriers or bottlenecks may still occur, further enforcing partner fidelity.

Under nitrogen-limited conditions, their ability to fix nitrogen provides an advantage over other species and enables them to form harmful blooms, which are increasing in frequency and negatively impact aquatic environments. Cyanophages (viruses infecting cyanobacteria) impose strong selective pressures on these populations, and although cyanobacteria can rapidly evolve resistance to these phages, there is a tradeoff between phage resistance and nitrogen fixation. Therefore, it remains unclear whether nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can evolve resistance without compromising nitrogen fixation under bloom-inducing nitrogen starvation. Here, we explore the evolution of phage resistance in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nostoc</span> sp. strain PCC 7120 and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii</span>) under nitrogen starvation. We found that phage-resistant strains evolved under nitrogen starvation, although resistance emerged more slowly than in nitrogen-rich environments. Whole-genome sequencing of 34 resistant strains revealed that mutations conferring resistance differed between nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-starved conditions. Nitrogen starvation selected for mutations predominantly in glycosyltransferase genes, which are associated with cell surface modifications. In contrast to resistant strains isolated under nitrogen-replete conditions, which exhibited impaired heterocyst formation, resistant strains selected under nitrogen starvation maintained their ability to form functional heterocysts and persist in nitrogen-limited environments. Our findings suggest that nitrogen availability influences the evolutionary trajectory of phage resistance, favoring mechanisms compatible with nitrogen fixation under nitrogen starvation. These results provide new insights into the ecological resilience of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria under phage predation and demonstrate that nitrogen availability affects the cost of resistance, evolutionary trajectories, and resistance mechanisms.</span>"

Clinical analyses demonstrated that pneumonia patients receiving ineffective prehospital antibiotic therapy showed gut bacterial depletion accompanied by fungal overgrowth (primarily <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Candida</span> spp.), with a positive correlation observed between fungal abundance and hospitalization duration.

Using <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Escherichia coli</span> to express five divergent copies of this toxin, we show that distantly related members of the family all retain the ability to inactivate ribosomes by adenine cleavage at the \u03b1-sarcin/ricin loop, the enzymatic hallmark of RIPs. However, when exposed to live insect and fungal cells, ribosome inactivation varies across the five toxins, suggesting cellular recognition or localization play a role in target specificity. To identify toxin domains required for specificity, we removed rapidly evolving \u201caccessory\u201d domains from two toxins. Both truncated toxins exhibit significantly increased activity on purified ribosomes <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in vitro</span>, suggesting one role of accessory domains is to reduce toxicity, which may help protect hosts from collateral damage. One of the truncated toxins also showed significantly reduced inactivation of cellular ribosomes <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in vivo</span>, indicating a role for accessory domains in cell specificity. Together, these data reveal a mechanism for symbiont discrimination between hosts and parasites and highlight how dynamic toxin evolution can contribute to stability and novelty in defensive symbiosis.</span>"

The concept of minimum selective concentrations (MSCs) has been adopted in environmental regulation to define maximum permissible antibiotic concentrations. Such empirically determined MSC values often fail to reflect the complexity of natural communities, where susceptibility and resistance-associated fitness costs vary widely across species. To address this limitation, computational approaches have been developed to predict no-effect concentrations for selection of antibiotic resistance (PNEC<sub>res</sub>) from routinely collected minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. However, these approaches, using assessment factors to convert MICs to PNEC<sub>res</sub>, often lack a strong ecological basis, undermining confidence in their predictions. Here, we propose a simple but biologically consistent framework to derive PNEC<sub>res</sub> values by integrating MIC data with probabilistic estimates of resistance-related fitness costs. We demonstrate mathematically and empirically that for typical high-level resistances, the MSC/MIC ratio is approximately equal to the resistance cost, allowing for cost-based estimation of MSCs. In experimental validation across 26 strain\u2013antibiotic combinations, 66% of computed MSCs deviated by less than factor two from empirical values. Leveraging these findings, we explored the general distribution of fitness costs of resistance determinants to establish a cost-based probabilistic model for replacing conventional fixed assessment factors. When applied to current MIC databases, our framework suggests that regulatory environmental threshold concentrations should be lowered by at least one order of magnitude to guard against selection for antibiotic resistance. Our approach offers a feasible and biologically transparent alternative for deriving PNEC<sub>res</sub> values in environmental risk assessment.</span>"

Mimicking their natural habitat at 70\u00b0C with a water current under optical microscopy, cells traveled distances up to 1\u00a0mm in 30\u00a0min, with infrequent directional changes. This long-distance surface migration is driven by type IV pili, facilitating vertical attachment at the cell pole, and shear-induced tilting of the cell body, resulting in alignment of the leading pole toward the direction of water flow. Direct visualization of type IV pili filaments and their dynamics revealed that rheotaxis is triggered by weakened attachment at the cell pole, regulated by ATPase activity, which was further validated by mathematical modeling. Flow experiments on 15 bacterial strains and species in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Deinococcota</span> (synonym <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Deinococcus Thermus</span>) phylum revealed that positive rheotaxis is highly conserved among rod-shaped <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thermaceae</span>, but absent in spherical-shaped <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Deinococcus</span>.

To test this, we contrasted community development in soil microcosms between two taxa-diverse microbiota originating from either topsoil [SoilCom (SC)] or freshwater lake [LakeCom (LC)], and a defined mixture of 21 soil bacteria (SynCom). When inoculated separately, SC and LC showed similar taxa and colonization patterns contributing to community growth and decline within the soil microcosms. SynCom transplants to either SC or LC under renewed growth conditions permanently altered their community trajectories, and slightly further converged their taxa compositions.

Moreover, human to human oral-fecal transmission is likely to intensify this dissemination cycle. Gut microbiota harboring ARGs not only drive clinical infections but also exacerbate diverse pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, amplified ARGs can re-enter environmental compartments through fecal discharge, establishing a persistent bidirectional \u201cgut-environment\u201d resistance transmission cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key metabolites derived from gut microbiota, potently suppress the horizontal transfer of ARGs. A high-fiber diet reshaped gut microbial composition, elevating SCFA production by 1.6-fold and reducing ARGs dissemination rates by up to 5.8-fold <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in vivo</span>.

Through metagenomic assembly and integration into an updated reference database, we found the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I. indri</span> fecal microbiome remains largely uncultivated (cultivated species representing &lt;0.1% relative abundance) and is largely specific to this primate species. After reconstructing 342 metagenome-assembled genomes encompassing 48 candidate species from a total of 22 samples (18 of which newly sequenced), we substantially improved microbiome mappability to 85% on average and found evidence for a proportionally large core microbiome. Social group membership emerged as the main determinant of both their taxonomic and functional gut microbiome composition. Using strain-level profiling, we detected extensive microbiome transmission within social groups, suggesting physical interaction is key in promoting microbiome acquisition. Strain sharing rates were highest between mothers and their offspring. Intergroup strain sharing was minimal and inversely correlated with geographical distance, aligning with the rare intergroup interactions and stable territory occupancy coupled with ongoing habitat fragmentation.

We conducted a high frequency sampling (three-times a week) in the oxic hypolimnion of a stratified mesoeutrophic reservoir during summer, characterized by stable physicochemical conditions and low water temperature. Using fluorescently labeled bacteria we estimated that ciliates and HNF contributed, on average, 30% and 70% to aggregated protistan bacterivory, respectively, and collectively removed about two thirds of daily hypolimnetic prokaryotic production. The ciliate community was analyzed by the quantitative protargol staining method. One scuticociliate morphotype dominated the hypolimnetic ciliate community, accounting for 82% of total ciliates and over 98% of total ciliate bacterivory, with average cell-specific uptake rate of 202 prokaryotes per hour.

The hydrolysis of inositol phosphates could be an important contributor to phosphorus cycling in phosphorus-limited marine ecosystems, yet this process remains poorly understood in marine contexts. In this study, we reveal substantial concentrations of inositol phosphates in marine macrophytes, including green, brown, and red algae as well as common seagrasses, suggesting that these organisms are likely major biological sources of inositol phosphates in the oceans. A comprehensive analysis of genes involved in inositol phosphates hydrolysis in global marine metagenomes and metatranscriptomes identified key roles for \u03b3-, \u03b1-, and \u03b4-proteobacteria, with additional contributions from Flavobacteriia. The degradation of marine inositol phosphates was predominantly mediated by alkaline \u03b2-propeller phytases, though genes associated with acidic cysteine phytases and purple acid phytases were also widely present. Community structure and functional traits linked to inositol phosphates degradation were shaped largely by stochastic processes. Further examination of enzyme activity at the protein and community levels indicated that phytate metabolism by marine microbes is likely a widespread phenomenon in the ocean. Overall, this study highlights inositol phosphates hydrolysis as an essential yet overlooked adaptation by marine microorganisms to address phosphorus limitations in ocean ecosystems.</span>"

Orphan and restriction-modification system methylases constitute the main methylation systems in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes can adapt to environmental fluctuations through orphan methylase regulation and phase variation of restriction-modification systems, which generate diversified methylomes that modulate the expression of genes.

The large number of stable consortia in this study enabled statistical validation of both previously observed and newly identified core microbiome functionalities in micronutrient biosynthesis, metabolite transport, and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Furthermore, core species showed significant enrichment of plasmids, and functions encoded on plasmids suggested plasmid-mediated roles in symbiotic interactions. Overall, our findings uncover the potential microbiomes recruited by key model cyanobacteria, demonstrate that laboratory-enriched consortia retain many taxonomic and functional traits observed more broadly in phototroph\u2013heterotroph assemblages, and show that model cyanobacteria can serve as robust hosts for uncovering functional roles underlying cyanobacterial community dynamics.</span>"

This is particularly relevant for bioaugmentation of oligotrophic environments where organic micropollutants (OMPs) hardly provide a selective C-source and exploitative competition for the scarce intrinsic organic carbon exists between inoculated OMP-degraders and resident microbiota. Building on microbial invasion theories, we tested the hypothesis that the success of bioaugmentation and associated OMP degradation can be enhanced through niche creation by supplying a selective carbon source for the introduced degrader. Sand filter microbiota reduced growth of the 2,6-dichlorobenzamide degrading strain <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Aminobacter niigataensis</span> MSH1 and 2,6-dichlorobenzamide degradation in different natural waters. This was counteracted by adding benzamide as a selective C-source for MSH1 resulting in a 3-fold faster 2,6-dichlorobenzamide biodegradation and a 6-fold increase in MSH1 growth. An additive biokinetic model underpredicted growth of MSH1 in the presence of sand filter microbiota suggesting that the community, despite its overall negative effect, supported MSH1 growth. Moreover, benzamide retarded 2,6-dichlorobenzamide degradation likely due to enzyme competitive inhibition. The results demonstrate the use of deliberately creating dedicated niches selective for the inoculum and the successful translation of ecological invasion theories into microbial community management, for improved bioaugmentation of complex communities.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Multicellular organisms are hosts to diverse communities of smaller organisms known as microbiomes. Plants have distinctive microbiomes that can provide important functions related to nutrition, defense, and stress tolerance. Empirical studies provide convincing evidence that in some\u2014but not all\u2014circumstances, belowground microbiomes help plants adapt to their local environment. The purpose of this review is to develop functional team selection (FTS) as a framework to help predict the conditions necessary for root microbiomes to generate local adaptation for their plant hosts. FTS envisions plants and their microbiomes as complex adaptive systems, and plant adaptations as emergent properties of these systems. If plants have the capacity to recognize and cultivate beneficial microbes and suppress pathogens, then it is possible for plants to evolve the capacity to gain adaptations by curating their microbiome. In resource-limited and stressful environments, the emergent functions of complex microbial systems may contribute to positive feedback linked to plant vigor, and ultimately, local adaptation. The key factors in this process are: (i) selective force, (ii) host constitution, (iii) microbial diversity, and (iv) time. There is increasing interest in harnessing beneficial microbial interactions in agriculture and many microbial growth-promoting products are commercially available, but their use is controversial because a large proportion of these products fail to consistently enhance plant growth. The FTS framework may help direct the development of durable plant-microbiome systems that enhance crop production and diminish pathogens. It may also provide valuable insights for understanding and managing other kinds of host-microbe systems.</span>"

Invertebrates generally rely on their innate immune system as the primary defense mechanism, operating at cellular and humoral levels to protect against pathogens. The hemolymph plays a vital role in immune responses, containing microbial communities that interact with the host\u2019s immune processes. Significant advances in molecular methods such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics have revealed the presence of a resident hemolymph microbiome and delineated its potentially vital role in immune homeostasis and overall host health. Accordingly, understanding the composition and role of the hemolymph microbiota, alongside innate immune responses, has become a key focus in recent research aimed at unraveling disease resistance mechanisms and supporting sustainable aquaculture practices. Here, we summarize the latest advancements in understanding the host and environmental factors that shape hemolymph microbiota diversity in various crustacean and mollusk species. We also consider the innate immune responses of the hosts, as these modulate interactions between hosts, microbes, and environments. Interactions within the hemolymph microbiome significantly affect host health, providing critical insights for advancing sustainable aquaculture.</span>"

Here, we used a multiomic approach to characterize symbiotic states of the facultatively symbiotic coral <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Oculina arbuscula</span> by generating genotype-controlled fragments of symbiotic and aposymbiotic tissue. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed no difference in bacterial communities between symbiotic states.

Single-cell RNAseq identified diverse cell clusters within seven cell types across symbiotic states. Specifically, the gastrodermal cell clusters containing algal-hosting cells from symbiotic tissue had higher expression of nitrogen cycling and lipid metabolism genes than aposymbiotic gastrodermal cells. Furthermore, differential enrichment of immune system gene pathways and lower expression of genes involved in immune regulation were observed in these gastrodermal cells from symbiotic tissue. However, there were no differences in gene expression in the immune cell cluster between symbiotic states. We conclude that there is evidence for compartmentalization of immune system regulation in specific gastrodermal cells in symbiosis. This compartmentalization may limit symbiosis tradeoffs by dampening immunity in algal-hosting cells while simultaneously maintaining general organismal immunity.</span>"

While several hypotheses have been advanced to explain microbial community compositional changes in response to disturbance, appropriate data to test these hypotheses is scarce, due to the challenges in delineating rare vs. abundant taxa and generalists vs. specialists, a prerequisite for testing the theories. Here, we operationally define these two key concepts by employing the patterns of coverage of a (target) genome by a metagenome to identify rare populations, and by borrowing the proportional similarity index from macroecology to identify generalists. We applied these concepts to time-series (field) metagenomes from the Piver\u2019s Island Coastal Observatory to establish that coastal microbial communities are resilient to major perturbations such as tropical cyclones and (uncommon) cold or warm temperature events, in part due to the response of rare populations. Therefore, these results provide support for the insurance hypothesis [i.e. the rare biosphere has the buffering capacity to mitigate the effects of disturbance]. Additionally, generalists appear to contribute proportionally more than specialists to community adaptation to perturbations like warming, supporting the disturbance-specialization hypothesis [i.e. disturbance favors generalists]. Several of these findings were also observed in replicated laboratory mesocosms that aimed to simulate disturbances such as a rain-driven washout of microbial cells and a labile organic matter release from a phytoplankton bloom. Taken together, our results advance understanding of the mechanisms governing microbial population dynamics under changing environmental conditions and have implications for ecosystem modeling.</span>"

Advances in genomics and microscopy have revealed the prevalence of endofungal bacteria across diverse fungal phyla, though their functions are primarily inferred from genomic and transcriptomic studies. Recent functional research has begun to shed light on their influence on fungal pathogenicity, physiology, and ecology. These findings raise fundamental questions about the establishment and benefits of bacterial-fungal endosymbiosis, as well as the role of endosymbionts in mediating fungal interactions with other organisms.This review provides an in-depth analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment and persistence of these symbioses. It also summarizes the current understanding of how endofungal bacteria impact fungal interactions with other organisms. For instance, endofungal bacteria contribute to the beneficial effects of fungi on plant health and fitness, protect fungal hosts from fungivorous predators, and enhance fungal virulence against plants, animals, and humans. These discoveries highlight the need for holistic investigations into bacterial-fungal endosymbiosis to fully understand their role in natural ecosystems.

Studies from pairwise interactions and synthetic communities indicate that metabolic interactions and spatial organisation can influence diversity, but the relevance of these factors in more complex communities is unclear. Here we used a cyanobacterial enrichment community that consistently forms millimetre-scale granular structures, to investigate compositional diversity and its stability. Over a year of passaging in media without significant carbon source, we found stable co-existence of 17 species belonging to diverse bacterial phyla. Metagenomic analysis revealed polysaccharide breakdown genes and complementary vitamin biosynthesis pathways in these species. Supporting these findings, we show growth of several isolated species on cyanobacterial slime components and experimentally verify vitamin exchanges between two members of the community. Several species had genes for (an)oxygenic photosynthesis and sulfur cycling, the expression of which we verified via metatranscriptomics. Consistent with this, we found that the granular structures displayed oxygen gradients with anoxic interiors. Cyanobacteria and other bacteria were distributed on the periphery and insides of these structures, respectively. Perturbation of the community via glucose addition resulted in fold increases of the heterotrophs, whereas disturbing the community by continual shaking led to fold reductions in several heterotrophs, including anoxygenic phototrophs. In contrast, removal of vitamins supplementation did not consistently alter species coverages, due to predicted vitamin sharing amongst community members. Taken together, these findings indicate that spatial organisation, microenvironment niche formation and metabolic interactions contribute to community compositional diversity and stability.</span>"

This study investigates the effects of climate warming on the taxonomic, network, and functional profiles of soil bacterial polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, leveraging fluorescence-activated cell sorting and single-cell Raman spectroscopy. Climate warming enhances both taxonomic and functional biodiversity of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms via biotic interactions and environmental filtering, with observed functionality-biodiversity relationships supporting the functional redundancy theory. Furthermore, polyphosphate-accumulating organism network complexity and stability rise under warming with strengthened positive relationships, supporting stress gradient hypothesis and the belief that complexity begets stability. Finally, polyphosphate-accumulating organisms are significantly correlated to key ecosystem functioning in carbon and phosphorus cycling under warming. Our study suggests that preserving polyphosphate-accumulating organism communities is crucial for maintaining soil ecosystem functioning and sustainable phosphorus management in a warming world and opens avenues for predicting the responses of other functional microbial groups to climate change, beneficially or maliciously.</span>"

We then mapped the evolution of flagellar motility across the Genome Taxonomy Database bacterial tree of life. We confirmed that the last common bacterial ancestor had flagellar motility and that the rate of loss of this motility was four-fold higher than the rate of gain. We showed that the presence of filament protein homologues was highly phylogenetically correlated with motility and that all species classified as motile contained at least one filament homologue. We calculated the rate of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and that the filament protein FliC was highly correlated with motility across the tree of life. We then measured the correlation of each flagellar motor protein with FliC and showed that the filament, rotor, and rod and hook proteins were all highly correlated with FliC, and thus with motility. We calculated the differential rates of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and quantified which genomes encoded for partial sets of flagellar proteins, indicating potential pathways by which motility could be lost. Overall, we show that filament, rod and hook and rotor proteins are conserved when flagellar motility is preserved and that the presence or absence of a FliC homologue is a good, simple predictor of whether or not a species has flagellar motility.</span>"

Light energy ultimately drives primary production and a cascade of daisy-chained metabolisms. Heterotrophic members of these communities remineralise organic material, decreasing net primary production, and returning nutrients to the aqueous phase. However, reduced inorganic and one-carbon substrates such as trace gases and those released as metabolic byproducts in deeper anoxic regions of the mat, could theoretically also fuel carbon fixation, mitigating carbon loss from heterotrophy and enhancing net primary production. Here, we investigated the intricate metabolic synergies that sustain community nutrient webs in a biomineralising microbial mat from a hypersaline lake. We recovered 331 genomes spanning 40 bacterial and archaeal phyla that influence the biogeochemistry of these ecosystems. Phototrophy is a major metabolism found in 17% of the genomes, but over 50% encode enzymes to harness energy from inorganic substrates and 12% co-encode chemosynthetic carbon fixation pathways that use sulfide and hydrogen as electron donors. We experimentally demonstrated that the microbial community oxidises ferrous iron, ammonia, sulfide, and reduced trace gas substrates aerobically and anaerobically. Furthermore, carbon isotope assays revealed that diverse chemosynthetic pathways contribute significantly to carbon fixation and organic matter production alongside photosynthesis. Chemosynthesis in microbial mats results from a complex suite of spatially organised metabolic interactions and continuous nutrient cycling, which decouples carbon fixation from the diurnal cycle, and enhances the net primary production of these highly efficient ecosystems.</span>"

These degraded reefs become locked in a \u201cmicrobialized\u201d state characterized by high microbial biomass, low oxygen, and heightened pathogenic activity that stymie efforts to outplant corals onto the reef, a common approach applied to restore these ecosystems. Over 18\u00a0months, we compared viral and microbial dynamics alongside physical and chemical parameters (\u201cwater quality\u201d) between two coral outplanting sites and two midwater reef mesocosms called Coral Arks. Seafloor sites exhibited microbialization, whereas Arks maintained conditions with higher viral abundances and virus-to-microbe ratios, smaller and less abundant microorganisms, and consistently higher dissolved oxygen, water flow, and light availability. These conditions, which we term \u201cviralized\u201d, supported enhanced coral growth and survival, greater benthic diversity, increased coral recruitment, reduced turf and macroalgae, and higher fish abundance compared to outplanting sites. Despite these benefits, analysis of microbial carbon metabolism genes revealed an underlying trend towards microbialization at both sites, reflecting larger-scale regional decline. These findings emphasize that microbial and physicochemical conditions are drivers of reef restoration outcomes; to be successful, restoration strategies must target the underlying environmental factors that support coral survival and resilience.

Despite the critical importance of understanding these interactions, accurately mapping and manipulating microbial interaction networks to achieve specific outcomes remains challenging. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) offer significant promise for predicting microbial metabolic functions from genomic data; however, traditional community GEMs typically rely on species abundance information, which may limit their predictive accuracy due to the absence of condition-specific gene expression or protein abundance data. Here, we introduce the Integration of Metatranscriptomes Into Community GEMs (IMIC) approach, which utilizes metatranscriptomic data to construct context-specific community models for predicting individual growth rates and metabolic interactions. By incorporating metatranscriptomic profiles, which reflect both gene expression activity and partially encode abundance information, IMIC could predict condition-specific flux distributions that enable the investigation of metabolite interactions among community members. Our results show that growth rates predicted by IMIC correlate strongly with relative as well as absolute abundance of species and offer a streamlined, automated procedure for estimating the single intrinsic parameter. Specifically, IMIC results in improved predictions of measured metabolite concentration changes compared with other approaches in our case study. We further demonstrate that this improvement is driven by the network-wide adjustment of flux bounds based on gene expression profiles. In conclusion, the IMIC approach enables the accurate prediction of individual growth rates and improves the model performance of predicting metabolite interactions, facilitating a deeper understanding of metabolic interdependencies within microbial communities.</span>"

Problematically, current microbial methane mitigation knowledge lacks detailed microbiome-centered insights, limiting translation across conditions and ecosystems. Here we utilize genome-resolved metatranscriptomes and metabolomes to assess the impact of a proposed methane inhibitor, catechin, on greenhouse gas emissions for high-methane-emitting peatlands. In microcosms, catechin drastically reduced methane emissions by 72%\u201384% compared to controls. Longitudinal sampling allowed for reconstruction of a catechin degradation pathway involving <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Actinomycetota</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clostridium</span>, which break down catechin into smaller phenolic compounds within the first 21\u00a0days, followed by degradation of phenolic compounds by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas_E</span> from Days 21 to 35. These genomes co-expressed hydrogen-uptake genes, suggesting hydrogenases may act as a hydrogen sink during catechin degradation and consequently reduce hydrogen availability to methanogens.

There was also reduced gene expression from genomes inferred to be functioning syntrophically with hydrogen-utilizing methanogens.

Bacterial success in exploiting this patchy microscale environment relies on sensing and swimming towards the hotspots, and upon arrival, growing on available substrates. However, the combined effect of chemotaxis and growth rate on bacterial community assembly has never been quantified. Here, we characterized chemotaxis and growth rate responses of seven representative copiotrophic marine bacteria to phytoplankton exometabolites, both for single species and for pairs of species. We compared these results to prediction of a mathematical null model of hotspot community assembly. Our results revealed that the bacterial strains exhibit diverse responses to phytoplankton metabolites, which can act as either signals, substrates, or both. Interactions between bacterial pairs resulted in chemotactic responses or growth rates different from model predictions in all of the 12 pairs tested (83% differed in chemotaxis, 33% in growth). These community dynamics indicate that inter-species interaction is another factor shaping early colonization of metabolite hotspots, with beneficial, detrimental, and neutral associations observed between bacterial species. Such complex ecological interactions impact chemotactic behaviors and growth rates of marine bacteria on resource hotspots, affecting their community compositions and associated functions relevant to the cycling of key elements including carbon.</span>"

Because research linking methanogenesis to human metabolism is limited, our goal with this exploratory analysis was to investigate relationships between methanogens and other hydrogenotrophs, along with the association of methanogens with human metabolizable energy (ME). Using results from a randomized crossover feeding study including a western diet and a high-fiber diet, well-characterized human participants, and continuous methane measurements, we analyzed hydrogenotroph abundance and activity, fecal and serum SCFAs, and host ME between high and low methane producers. We detected methanogens in about one-half of participants. We found no evidence that methanogens\u2019 consumption of hydrogen to produce methane affected other hydrogenotrophs. High methane producers had greater serum propionate and greater gene and transcript abundance of a key enzyme of the hydrogen-consuming, propionate-producing succinate pathway.

This study integrates planktonic (5\u20134000\u00a0m) and particle-associated (4000\u00a0m) metagenomic samples in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, along with particulate export flux data at 4000\u00a0m, to investigate the vertical transport of giant viruses and their correlation with carbon export through space and time. By analyzing metagenomic samples over a period of 6\u00a0years across 15 depths, we curated a database of 37 giant virus population genomes and 1496 contigs and investigated their spatiotemporal variability and functional capacity in the open ocean. We reported multiple lines of evidence supporting the viral shuttle hypothesis, including the vertical transport of giant viruses from the upper ocean to abyssal depths and their positive correlation with particulate carbon export flux at 4000\u00a0m, particularly a giant species closely related to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Phaeocystis globosa</span> virus known to infect a bloom-forming alga. We identified giant viruses encoding diverse auxilary metabolic genes, including genes associated with photosynthesis, nutrient transport, and energy metabolism.

Recent research has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi extend this recognition beyond 15\u00a0cm by transporting flavonoids along their hyphae. In soil, common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) linking plants are formed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Dinitrogen fixation by diazotrophic microorganisms, usually favored in low reactive nitrogen systems, may become an increasingly important source of nitrogen in the Arctic. Previous studies have shown that non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are dominant in the Arctic Ocean. Lacking a photosynthetic apparatus, non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs may utilize organic particles as carbon- and energy-rich niches. However, cyanobacterial diazotrophs may also form particles by aggregation. To further understand diazotroph-particle associations, here we study the chemotactic behavior and colonization dynamics of diazotrophs on model organic particles using a modified chemotaxis assay. Artificial organic particles (agarose, alginate) were incubated with surface seawater communities from four contrasted stations in the Barents Sea, and their DNA was sequenced targeting <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nifH</span> and 16S rRNA genes after 2, 36, and 72\u00a0h of incubation.

We also observe niche partitioning among microbial groups, with diazotrophs colonizing nitrogen-poor, carbon-rich particles earlier than non-diazotrophic prokaryotes. As Arctic warming proceeds, increased algal blooms may expand the niches for particle-associated diazotrophs, whose dinitrogen fixation supports phytoplankton growth and primary productivity.</span>"

Compared to known mechanisms of iron acquisition and conservation in autotrophic protists (e.g. diatoms), those of dinoflagellates remain unclear, despite their frequent presence in offshore iron-limited waters. Here, we investigate the strategies of an ecologically important mixotrophic dinoflagellate to coping with low iron conditions. Coupled gene expression and physiological responses as a function of iron availability were examined in oceanic and coastal strains of the dinoflagellate <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Karlodinium</span>. Under iron-replete conditions, grazing was only detected in coastal variants, resulting in faster growth rates compared to when grown autotrophically. Under iron-limited conditions, all isolates exhibited slower growth rates, reduced photosynthetic efficiencies, and lower cellular iron quotas than in iron-replete conditions. However, oceanic isolates exhibited higher relative growth rates compared to coastal isolates under similar low iron concentrations, suggesting they are better adapted to coping under iron limitation. Yet the oceanic isolates did not exhibit the ability to appreciably reduce cell volume or increase iron-use efficiencies compared to the coastal isolates to cope with iron limitation, as often observed in oceanic diatoms. Rather, molecular pathway analysis and corresponding gene expression patterns suggest that oceanic <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Karlodinium</span> utilizes a high-affinity iron uptake system when iron is low. Our findings reveal cellular mechanisms by which dinoflagellates have adapted to low iron conditions, further shedding light on how they potentially survive in variable iron regions of the world\u2019s oceans.</span>"

Although these pathways perform a similar function, they are phylogenetically unrelated, indicating independent evolutionary origins. Here, we report an extracellular electron transfer mechanism in which the high-current producing bacterium <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Desulfuromonas acetexigens</span> differentially co-expresses, at transcript and protein levels, the porin-cytochrome, outer-membrane cytochrome, and metal-reducing pathways, along with high-molecular-weight cytochromes containing a large number of hemes (up to 86 heme-binding motifs), under extracellular electron transfer growth conditions (i.e. electrode under set potential or naturally occurring iron oxide minerals as the electron acceptor). Additionally, we identified over 40 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Desulfobacterota</span> species from diverse ecological environments that encode the outer-membrane cytochrome and metal-reducing pathways, with the majority also expressing the porin-cytochrome pathway.

With exometabolomics and genome-scale metabolic modeling, we estimated the degree of resource competition between bacterial pairs.

Additionally, a primary strain classified as facilitative based on sequential interactions increased total algal-derived carbon assimilation by 7.6 times, integrated over all members, compared to the competitive primary strain. Our findings suggest that the degree of interaction between bacteria along a spectrum from competitive to facilitative is directly linked to algal carbon drawdown.</span>"

We found a continuous warming (by ~4.3\u00b0C in mean annual sea surface temperature) from 12 to 4.3 kiloyears before present (kyr BP), which caused an initial increase in the relative abundance and diversity of dinoflagellates, followed by a decrease reaching the lowest value, probably due to thermal stress. However, dinoflagellates flourished again after 4.3 kyr BP, coinciding with a rapid increase in human activities. Further analyses indicated that warming and environmental changes during the Holocene favored dinoflagellate generalists over specialists. These generalists have also been abundant throughout contemporary low- and mid-latitude regions, whereas specialists were more abundant at higher latitudes.

Moreover, the homogenization of dinoflagellate communities resulting from generalist expansion may significantly reduce the complexity of marine plankton interactions and compromise ecosystem services under global warming.</span>"

Here, we perform experimental evolution on continuous cultures of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Escherichia coli</span> carrying the tetracycline resistance <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tet</span> operon to identify specific mutations that adapt drug responses to different dynamic regimens of drug administration.

We use a mathematical model of the dynamics of antibiotic responses to show that sudden exposure to large drug concentrations overwhelm regulated responses, which cannot induce resistance fast enough, resulting in selection for constitutive expression of resistance. These results help explain the frequent loss of regulation of antibiotic resistance by pathogens evolved in clinical environments.

We explored how sea cucumber grazing alters the sediment microbiome by leveraging a healthy sea cucumber population on a reef in French Polynesia. We used quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and shotgun metagenomics to compare the sediment microbiome in cages placed <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in situ</span> with or without sea cucumbers. We hypothesized that grazing would lower microbial biomass, change sediment microbiome composition, and deplete sediment metagenomes of anaerobic metabolisms, likely due to aeration of the sediments. Sea cucumber grazing resulted in a 75% reduction in 16S rRNA gene abundances and reshaped microbiome composition, causing a significant decrease of cyanobacteria and other phototrophs relative to ungrazed sediments. Grazing also resulted in a depletion of genes associated with cyanotoxin synthesis, suggesting a potential link to coral health. In contrast to expectations, grazed sediment metagenomes were enriched with marker genes of diverse anaerobic or microaerophilic metabolisms, including those encoding high oxygen affinity cytochrome oxidases. This enrichment differs from patterns linked to other bioturbating invertebrates. We hypothesize that grazing enriches anaerobic processes in sediment microbiomes through removal of oxygen-producing autotrophs, fecal deposition of sea cucumber gut-associated anaerobes, or modification of sediment diffusibility. These results suggest that sea cucumber harvesting influences biogeochemical processes in reef sediments, potentially mediating coral survival by altering the sediment microbiome and its production of coral-influencing metabolites.</span>"

However, the role of soil-water interface in controlling N<sub>2</sub>O emissions remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the millimeter-scale redox gradient across the soil-water interface generates corresponding distinct niche for N-cycling microorganisms that collectively regulate the production and consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O over the same spatial scale. The abundance, transcriptional activity and spatial organization of different N-cycling guilds across the soil-water interface were characterized in mesocosms from three different paddy soils with different N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Results demonstrated millimeter-scale stratification of N-cycling microbial activity across the soil-water interface, and in particular within the first 10\u00a0mm of flooded soils. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms were only transcriptionally active in the top 4\u00a0mm, suggesting a previously underestimated contribution to N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from wetlands. Variation in N<sub>2</sub>O accumulation was observed across the soil-water interface, with the highest concentrations measured at either the soil-water interface or in the deeper anoxic layer of paddy soils. Despite this difference, N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing microorganisms exhibited high transcriptional activity at the soil-water interface in all soils, suggesting that there is a microbial-mediated sink for N<sub>2</sub>O across the soil-water interface that can reduce N<sub>2</sub>O produced from both oxic and anoxic layers.

Major <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. coli</span> lineages (phylogroups or subgroups) exhibited similar fitness but diverse strategies, from strong colonisers residing few days in the gut to poor colonisers residing for years. Strains with the largest number of extra-intestinal virulence associated genes and highest pathogenicity also resided for longest in hosts. Furthermore, the residence of a strain was more strongly reduced when it competed with other strains from the same phylogroup than from another phylogroup, suggesting niche differentiation between phylogroups. Based on a discrete-state Markov model developed to describe <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. coli</span> dynamics in a host population, we found that the trade-off and niche differentiation acted together as equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms allowing phylogroups to coexist over long periods of time.

These microorganisms collectively formed a robust and densely packed symbiotic biofilm, with BB being the predominant member in terms of numerical abundance. This phenomenon was concomitant with a marked elevation in the levels of AI-2 and c-di-GMP. ABB exhibits the capability to inhibit crucial biological indicators of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">C. difficile</span> (CD), such as toxin production, through the secretion of substantial quantities of lactic acid.

ABB demonstrated exceptional efficacy in a CDI murine model, as evidenced by a substantial enhancement in survival rates and intestinal short-chain fatty acid level, the down-regulation of inflammation-associated cytokine secretion, a notable reduction in fecal CD toxin levels, and CD viable bacterial counts. Concurrently, there was an augmentation in the level of gut microbial diversity, accompanied by a rapid reduction in Enterococcus abundance.

Here, we tracked microbiome assembly in association with initially axenic phytoplankton when incubated in seawater originating from four nearshore locations along a continental-scale environmental gradient of North America. Microbiome assembly was highly deterministic. Unexpectedly, host species identity was the overwhelming driver of microbiome community assembly despite continental-scale variation in the environment. Although secondary to host identity, the environment was a significant driver of microbiome assembly for each species evaluated, which, in turn, conferred cascading effects on host fitness as shown by thermal tolerance growth assays. We also found that host-specific microbiomes had host-specific fitness effects, particularly under thermally stressful conditions. Overall, our results advance our understanding of microbiome assembly by empirically demonstrating that although variation among host microbiomes imparted by the local environment has significant implications for host health, the host species is the overwhelming driver of microbiome assembly regardless of wide-scale variation in the environment.</span>"

The corallicolids are a clade of apicomplexans that infect a wide variety of anthozoans worldwide and can influence the thermal tolerance of habitat-forming corals. Despite their potentially important impacts on reef ecosystems, much of the basic biology and ecology of corallicolids remains unclear. Apicomplexans often have a closed life cycle, with minimal environmental exposure and sometimes multiple hosts.

When compared to their Ca dependent counterparts, there is an emerging picture that Ln-dependent versions of these enzymes are generally more efficient, are preferentially upregulated in the presence of Ln when there is functional redundancy, and may even be evolutionarily older. Ln-utilising microbes have furthermore evolved diverse means of solubilizing and acquiring Ln, enabling them to utilize Ln even at trace concentrations. The ocean is the largest dissolved organic carbon pool on Earth, yet the diversity and prevalence of Ln-dependent carbon metabolisms in the ocean is unknown. Here we show that Ln-utilising methanol-, ethanol- and putative sorbose- and glucose-dehydrogenase genes are ubiquitous in the ocean and are highly transcribed, despite extremely low concentrations of Ln in seawater. These enzymes occur in the genomes of 20% of marine microbes, with several individual organisms hosting dozens of unique Ln-utilising enzymes. We found that active microbial methanol oxidation in the ocean is almost entirely Ln-dependent. The widespread biological utility of Ln may help to explain the nutrient-like vertical concentration profiles of these elements in ocean waters and may exert an influence on rare earth element concentration patterns. Microbial Ln-utilisation is a poorly understood component of marine rare earth element biogeochemistry, with potentially important implications for the carbon cycle.

In this review, we assess the current knowledge of the contribution of fungi to soil aggregation and set a new research agenda to quantify fungal-mediated aggregation across different climates and soils. Our review highlights three main knowledge gaps: (1) the lack of quantitative data and mechanistic understanding of aggregate turnover under field conditions, (2) lack of data on the biochemical and biological mechanisms by which filamentous fungi influence soil aggregation, and (3) uncharacterized contribution of soil fungi across environments. Adopting a trait-based approach to increase the level of mechanistic understanding between fungal diversity and soil structure seems promising, but will need additional experiments in which fungal diversity is manipulated by either removal through sieving or dilution, or addition through using synthetic communities of cultured fungi.

However, the extent to which these responses are shaped by an organism\u2019s phylogeny, or the climate history of a given environment is poorly understood. This study examines the responses of phylogenetically similar bacteria from semi-arid and humid tropical forest soils to osmotic and matric stress using synchrotron radiation-based Fourier Transform Infrared spectromicroscopy. This non-destructive approach depicts the biochemical phenotype for whole cells under control and stress conditions. We observed that, under osmotic stress, bacteria upregulated cell-signaling pathways, rapidly turned over lipid-storage compounds, and increased osmolyte production. In contrast, matric stress induced a more muted response, typically elevating the production of carbohydrate stress compounds, such as glycine betaine and trehalose. Whereas phylogenetically similar bacteria showed comparable biochemistry under control conditions, climate history played an important role in regulating responses to stress, whereby a stronger metabolic response was observed from semi-arid relative to tropical forest isolates. We conclude that bacterial stress response to drought can be more diverse than previously observed and regulated by both phylogeny and climate history.</span>"

To explore evolution in SAR11, we analyzed high-quality, single-cell amplified genomes, and companion metagenomes from an oxygen minimum zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, where the SAR11 make up ~20% of the total microbial community. Our results show that SAR11 do form several sequence-discrete species, but their ANI range of discreteness is shifted to lower identities between 86% and 91%, with intra-species ANI ranging between 91% and 100%. Measuring recent gene exchange among these genomes based on a recently developed methodology revealed higher frequency of homologous recombination within compared to between species that affects sequence evolution at least twice as much as diversifying point mutation across the genome. Recombination in SAR11 appears to be more promiscuous compared to other prokaryotic species, likely due to the deletion of universal genes involved in the mismatch repair, and has facilitated the spread of adaptive mutations within the species (gene sweeps), further promoting the high intraspecies diversity observed. Collectively, these results implicate rampant, genome-wide homologous recombination as the mechanism of cohesion for distinct SAR11 species.</span>"

By passaging a widespread pathogen (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Staphylococcus aureus</span>) and a natural microbiota community across populations of nematode hosts, we show that the pathogen displaced microbiota and reduced species richness, but maintained its virulence across generations. Conversely, pathogen populations and microbiota passaged in isolation caused more host harm relative to their respective no-host controls.

Whole genome sequencing revealed shifts in the mode of selection from directional (on pathogens evolving in isolation) to fluctuating (on pathogens evolving in host microbiota). This approach also revealed that competitive interactions with the microbiota drove early pathogen genomic diversification.

One common strategy is the production of toxic compounds to inhibit competitors, but the strength and direction of selection for this strategy vary depending on the environment. Existing theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that growth in spatially structured environments makes toxin production more beneficial because competitive interactions are localized. Because higher growth rates reduce the length scale of interactions in structured environments, theory predicts that toxin production should be especially beneficial under these conditions. We tested this hypothesis by developing a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach and complementing it with comparative genomics to investigate the impact of growth rate on selection for costly toxin production.

In this study, we collected 392 non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes from different oceans, with 18% of these SAR202 genomes characterized by small genome sizes (&lt;2 Mbp), low GC content (&lt;40%), and high gene density. The 70 genome-streamlined SAR202 bacteria constitute more than an average of 90% of SAR202 in the euphotic zone and exhibit streamlined metabolic features compared to the dark ocean SAR202. Genome-streamlined SAR202 is distributed in many major SAR202 lineages (i.e. I, II, III, and VI). Phylogenomic analysis shows that the genome-streamlined SAR202 clades diverged from the non-genome-streamlined SAR202 lineages and evolved independently within the same clades. Certain genes are enriched in genome-streamlined SAR202, such as proteorhodopsin genes and the coding genes of major facilitator superfamily transporters, nucleoside transporters, and deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase, indicating their adaptation to sunlit oligotrophic water. A detailed comparison between genome-streamlined SAR202 and non-genome-streamlined SAR202 was made to illustrate their distinct niche distribution and metabolic buildup.

The objective of this study is to identify the factors influencing the interaction of two virulent phages with different <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> growth states (planktonic, an infected epithelial cell line, and biofilm) by measuring the bacterial time-kill and individual phage replication kinetics.

In static biofilms, the phage combination displayed initial inhibition of biofilm dispersal, but sustained control was achieved only by combining phages and the meropenem antibiotic. In contrast, adherent biofilms showed tolerance to phage and/or meropenem, suggesting a spatio-temporal variation in the phage\u2013bacterial interaction. The kinetics of adsorption of each phage to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P. aeruginosa</span> during single or co-administration were comparable.

We conducted a microcosm experiment with soils manipulated at varying levels of community structure (via dilution-to-extinction) and subjected these to pairwise coalescence scenarios. Overall, our results revealed variable patterns of abiotic and biotic donor dominance across distinct treatment sets. First, we show the occasional presence of an upfront stringent abiotic filter to disproportionally favor a donor biotic dominance through a \u201chome-field advantage\u201d mechanism, with abiotic factors explaining &gt;90% of the variance in community structure. Functional community metrics (i.e. carbon metabolism and extracellular enzymatic activities) were significantly linked to donor contributions in these cases. Second, in the absence of abiotic dominance, interspecific interactions gained importance, with abiotic variables explaining &lt;40% of the variance. Here, functional redundancy in donor communities (e.g. lower dilution) led to nonsignificant relationships between donor contributions and functional metrics.

Dietary choices impact the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota that ultimately modulate host health. This raises the possibility that health outcomes based on dietary protein sources might be driven by interactions between dietary protein and the gut microbiota. In this study, we determined the effects of seven different sources of dietary protein on the gut microbiota of mice using an integrated metagenomics-metaproteomics approach. The protein abundances measured by metaproteomics can provide microbial species abundances, and evidence for the molecular phenotype of microbiota members because measured proteins indicate the metabolic and physiological processes used by a microbial community. We showed that dietary protein source significantly altered the species composition and overall function of the gut microbiota. Different dietary protein sources led to changes in the abundance of microbial proteins involved in the degradation of amino acids and the degradation of glycosylations conjugated to dietary protein. In particular, brown rice and egg white protein increased the abundance of amino acid degrading enzymes. Egg white protein increased the abundance of bacteria and proteins usually associated with the degradation of the intestinal mucus barrier.

Here, we conducted a long-term metagenomic investigation on the composition of bacterial and phage communities of monthly collected activated sludge (AS) samples from two full-scale wastewater treatment plants over 6 years and found that DSs were widespread in AS, with 91.1% of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) having more than one complete DS. The stability of the bacterial community was maintained under the fluctuations of the phage community, and DS abundance and phage abundance were strongly positively correlated; there was a 0\u20133-month time lag in the responses of DSs to phage fluctuations. The rapid turnover of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat spacer repertoires further highlighted the dynamic nature of bacterial defense mechanisms. A pan-immunity phenomenon was also observed, with nearly identical MAGs showing significant differences in DS composition, which contributed to community stability at the species level. This study provides novel insights into the complexity of phage\u2013bacteria interactions in complex bacterial communities and reveals the key roles of DSs in stabilizing bacterial community structure and function.</span>"

In particular, carbon monoxide and hydrogen degradation can be of crucial importance for pioneering microbial communities colonising new, oligotrophic environmental niches, such as fresh volcanic deposits or the aerial interface of the phyllosphere. After volcanic eruptions, trace gas metabolism helps pioneer colonisers to initiate soil formation in ash deposits and on recently solidified lava, a vital ecosystem service. Similarly, in the phyllosphere, bacteria colonising newly emerging leaves and shoots, and/or persisting on the oligotrophic surface of plants, also benefit from trace gas oxidation and, given the global size of this habitat, likely constitute a significant sink for these trace gases affecting atmospheric chemistry. Herein, we review the current state of knowledge surrounding microbial oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and discuss how this may contribute to niche colonisation in oligotrophic ecosystems.</span>"

In such contexts, the benefits of self-destructive cooperators remain within homogeneous groups of self-destructive cooperators, preserving the sacrifice value and ensuring its maintenance. To validate our hypothesis, we employ a synthetic self-destructive cooperators-cheaters system and develop automated experiments to monitor and operate the subgroups with diverse growth behaviors due to strong segregation. Ultimately, we demonstrate self-destructive cooperators is maintained under strong segregation. High stress further enhances self-destructive cooperators by reducing the benefits received by cheaters in heterogeneous subgroups.

Theoretical models have highlighted the ecological complexity of spatio-temporal dynamics, which can lead to the emergence of complex patterns, including nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior, important mechanisms for maintaining of biodiversity. However, these dynamics are difficult to observe experimentally due to a lack of temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we show that even a single-species system exhibits complex spatio-temporal patterns without external forcing where order and chaos coexist (edge of chaos). Automated analyses of experimental dynamics of cells of a ciliate on a microfluidic chip environment with 50 interconnected patches documented pattern formation, including chaos-like dynamics, using several analytical methods. Different initial conditions caused changes in patterns, revealing the complexity and principal unpredictability of self-organized pattern formation. A model containing the stochastic fluctuations of the experiment verified the deterministic nature of patterns. The results show the intrinsic complexity of ecological systems, challenging predictions in nature conservation. Our results bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimental observations, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of living systems and their spatio-temporal organization.</span>"

As microbial communities are inherently capable of rapid evolution, responses of earthworms and associated microbiota (i.e. earthworm holobionts) to global environmental change may likely involve the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes and feedback. Although species-level responses of earthworms to global environmental change are well studied, the potential ecological and evolutionary responses of earthworm holobionts to environmental change remain unexplored. Here, we provide a conceptual framework to elaborate on the complex network of earthworm host\u2013microbiota interactions that modify their traits in response to global environmental change, jointly shaping their ecology and evolution. Based on the literature, we synthesize evidence of global environmental change impacts on earthworm host\u2013microbiota and discuss evidence of their ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change. Lastly, we highlight the agro- and eco-system-level consequences of environmental change-mediated shift in earthworm host\u2013microbiota functions. Soil legacies of environmental change have cascading detrimental impacts on the abundance, diversity, and functional dynamics of earthworm host\u2013microbiota interactions in agriculture and ecosystems. The primary mechanisms driving such responses of earthworm hosts and associated microbial communities to environmental change include altered litter quality and host dietary preferences, competitive interactions and exclusion, habitat homogenization, and a shift in soil physicochemical and biological processes.

In these low-nutrient environments, they are among the most important primary producers. Systematic studies of radiolarian biology are limited because radiolaria are non-culturable and prone to damage during sampling. To obtain insight into the mechanistic basis of radiolarian photosymbiosis, we address here the metabolic contributions of the partners to the performance of the holobiont. Therefore, we describe the metabolic inventory of two highly abundant photosymbiotic radiolaria\u2014colony-forming Collodaria and single-celled Acantharia and compare their metabolomes to metabolomes of respective free-living algae. Most of the metabolites detected in the symbiosis are not present in the free-living algae, suggesting a significant transformation of symbionts\u2019 metabolites by the host. The metabolites identified in the holobiont and the free-living algae encompass molecules of primary metabolism and a number of osmolytes, including dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Mass spectrometry imaging revealed the presence of dimethylsulfoniopropionate in the symbionts and host cells, indicating that the algae provide osmolytic protection to the host. Furthermore, our findings suggest a possible dependence of Collodaria on symbiotic vitamin B<sub>3</sub>. Distinctive differences in phospholipid composition between free-living and symbiotic stages indicate that the algal cell membrane may undergo rearrangement in the symbiosis.

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Despite the critical role rhizosphere microbiomes play in plant growth, manipulating microbial communities for improved plant productivity remains challenging. One reason for this is the lack of knowledge on how complex substrates secreted in the microbiome ultimately shape the microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interaction in relation to plant growth. One such complex substrate is poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid, which is a microbially derived extracellular polymer. While it has previously been linked with plant growth-promotion, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show that this compound benefits plants by fostering cross-feeding networks between rhizosphere bacteria. We first experimentally demonstrate that poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid application increases potassium bioavailability for tomato plants by driving a shift in the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. Specifically, application of poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid increased the relative abundance of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas nitroreducens</span> L16 and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas monteilii</span> L20 bacteria which both promoted tomato potassium assimilation by secreting potassium-solubilizing pyruvic acid and potassium-chelating siderophores, respectively. Although either <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pseudomonas</span> strain could not metabolize poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid directly, the application of poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid promoted the growth of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bacillus</span> species, which in turn produced metabolites that could promote the growth of both <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P. nitroreducens</span> L16 and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P. monteilii</span> L20.

The conservation of HMGR catalytic residues in FcrA suggests that the two enzymes have a similar catalytic mechanism, whereas an elongated substrate-binding pocket and distinct residues may explain FcrA's selectivity for fatty acyl-CoA.

Comparative genomic analyses, axenic growth assays, and proteomic analyses were used here to investigate organic nitrogen acquisition mechanisms in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Syn/Pro</span> clade. Comparative analysis of the genomes of 295 freshwater and marine strains of picocyanobacteria identified a large diversity of amino acid transporters, the absence of degradation pathways for five amino acids (asparagine, phenylalanine, serine, tryptophan, and tyrosine), and alternative mechanisms for chitin assimilation (direct chitin catabolism vs initial acetylation to chitosan and subsequent degradation). Growth assays demonstrated the widespread bioavailability of amino acids, including basic amino acids though the known basic amino acid transporter is not encoded. This suggests further genetic components are involved, either through extracellular catabolism or the presence of novel transporters. Proteomic analysis demonstrates the dual utilization of nitrogen and carbon from the amino acid substrate and provides evidence for a mild stress response through the up-regulation of lysine biosynthesis and FtsH1, potentially caused by accumulation of secondary metabolites.

However, our understanding of how <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Akkermansia muciniphila</span> senses and responds to host gastrointestinal signals remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. muciniphila</span> exhibits rapid growth, facilitated by its self-produced carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), with key enzymes such as glutamate decarboxylase, carbonic anhydrase, and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase playing pivotal roles. Additionally, we design a novel delivery system, comprising calcium carbonate, inulin, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. muciniphila</span>, and sodium alginate, which enhances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. muciniphila</span> growth and facilitates the expression of part probiotic genes in mice intestinal milieu. Notably, the administration of this delivery system induces weight loss in mice fed high-fat diets. Furthermore, we elucidate the significant impact of CO\u2082 on the composition and functional genes of the human gut microbiota, with genes encoding carbonic anhydrase and amino acid metabolism enzymes exhibiting heightened responsiveness. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which gut commensal bacteria sense and respond to gaseous molecules, thereby promoting growth. Moreover, they suggest the potential for designing rational therapeutic strategies utilizing live bacterial delivery systems to enhance probiotic growth and ameliorate gut microbiota-related diseases.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Dinoflagellates are an abundant and diverse group of protists that inhabit aquatic environments worldwide. They are characterized by numerous unique cellular and molecular traits, and have adapted to an unusually broad range of life strategies, including phototrophy, heterotrophy, parasitism, and all combinations of these. For most microbial groups, transitions from marine to freshwater environments are relatively rare, as changes in salinity are thought to lead to significant osmotic challenges that are difficult for the cell to overcome. Recent work has shown that dinoflagellates have overcome these challenges relatively often in evolutionary time, but because this is mostly based on single gene trees with low overall support, many of the relationships between freshwater and marine groups remain unresolved. Normally, phylogenomics could clarify such conclusions, but despite the recent surge in data, virtually no freshwater dinoflagellates have been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, we generated 30 transcriptomes from cultures and single cells collected from freshwater environments to infer a robustly supported phylogenomic tree from 217 conserved genes, resolving at least seven transitions to freshwater in dinoflagellates. Mapping the distribution of ASVs from freshwater environmental samples onto this tree confirms these groups and identifies additional lineages where freshwater dinoflagellates likely remain unsampled. We also sampled two species of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Durinskia</span>, a genus of \u201cdinotoms\u201d with both marine and freshwater lineages containing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nitzschia</span>-derived tertiary plastids.

Consequently, the serpentinite-hosted biosphere offers insights into the earliest life, the habitable limits for life, and the potential for life on other planets. However, the support of abundant microbial communities by serpentinites was only recognized ~20\u00a0years ago with the discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents emanating serpentinized fluids. Here, we review the microbial ecology of both marine and continental serpentinization-influenced ecosystems in conjunction with a comparison of publicly available metagenomic sequence data from these communities to provide a global perspective of serpentinite microbial ecology. Synthesis of observations across global systems reveal consistent themes in the diversity, ecology, and functioning of communities. Nevertheless, individual systems exhibit nuances due to local geology, hydrology, and input of oxidized, near-surface/seawater fluids.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic microorganisms whose origin date back 400 million years. They form symbiotic associations with the vast majority of terrestrial plants, helping them to obtain nutrients from the soil in exchange for carbon. At the more complex level, soil bacteria participate in the symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plants: they obtain carbon from the exudation of hyphae connected to the roots and compensate for the limited saprophytic capacity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by mineralizing organic compounds. Therefore, plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria constitute a continuum that may be accompanied by multiple forms of cooperation. In this review, we first analyzed the functional complementarities and differences between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Secondly, we discussed the resource exchange relationship between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from the perspective of biological market theory and \u201csurplus carbon\u201d hypothesis. Finally, on the basis of mechanisms for maintaining cooperation, direct and indirect reciprocity in the hyphosphere, induced by the availability of external resource and species fitness, were examined. Exploring these reciprocal cooperations will provide a better understanding of the intricate ecological relationships between plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria as well as their evolutionary implications.</span>"

Denitrification\u2014the stepwise reduction of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogenous gases\u2014is inherently modular, catalysed either by a single microorganism (termed complete denitrifier) or by consortia of partial denitrifiers. Despite the pivotal role of denitrification in biogeochemical cycles and environmental biotechnologies, the ecological factors selecting for complete versus partial denitrifiers remain poorly understood. In this perspective, we critically review over 1500 published metagenome-assembled genomes of denitrifiers from diverse and globally relevant ecosystems. Our findings highlight the widespread occurrence of labour division and the dominance of partial denitrifiers in complex ecosystems, contrasting with the prevalence of complete denitrifiers only in simple laboratory cultures. We challenge current labour division theories centred around catabolic pathways, and discuss their limits in explaining the observed niche partitioning. Instead, we propose that labour division benefits partial denitrifiers by minimising resource allocation to denitrification, enabling broader metabolic adaptability to oligotrophic and dynamic environments. Conversely, stable, nutrient-rich laboratory cultures seem to favour complete denitrifiers, which maximise energy generation through denitrification. To resolve the ecological significance of metabolic trade-offs in denitrifying microbiomes, we advocate for mechanistic studies that integrate mixed-culture enrichments mimicking natural environments, multi-meta-omics, and targeted physiological characterisations. These undertakings will greatly advance our understanding of global nitrogen turnover and nitrogenous greenhouse gases emissions.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The maintenance of bacterial diversity at both species and strain levels is crucial for the sustainability of honey bee gut microbiota and host health. Periodic or random fluctuation in diet typically alters the metabolic niches available to gut microbes, thereby continuously reshaping bacterial diversity and interspecific interactions. It remains unclear how closely related bacteria adapt to these fluctuations and maintain coexistence within the bee gut. Here, we demonstrate that the five predominant <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gilliamella</span> species associated with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Apis cerana</span>, a widely distributed Asiatic honey bee, have diverged in carbohydrate metabolism to adapt to distinct nutrient niches driven by dietary fluctuation. Specifically, the glycan-specialists gain improved growth on a pollen-rich diet, but are overall inferior in competition to non-glycan-specialist on either a simple sugar or sugar-pollen diet, when co-inoculated in the bee host and transmitted across generations. Strikingly, despite of their disadvantage in a high-sugar condition, the glycan-specialists are found prevalent in natural <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. cerana</span> guts. We further reveal that these bacteria have adopted a life history strategy characterized by high biomass yield on a low-concentration sugar diet, allowing them to thrive under poor nutritional conditions, such as when the bee hosts undergo periodical starvation. Transcriptome analyses indicate that the divergence in life history strategies is attributed to gene expression programming rather than genetic variation.

Iron is supplied from diverse sources such as the atmosphere and the geosphere, and hence iron biogeochemical research has focused on identifying and quantifying such sources of \u201cnew\u201d iron. However, the recycling of this new iron fuels up to 90% of the productivity in vast oceanic regions. Evidence points to the key role of microbes in mediating this recycling, referred to as the \u201cferrous wheel\u201d, that remobilises iron initially supplied to ocean biota. In the iron-limited subantarctic waters of the Southern Ocean, iron uptake is dominated by microbes smaller than 2\u00a0\u03bcm and exhibits seasonal and depth-related variations. The microbial community within the &lt;2\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction comprises heterotrophic bacteria and picophytoplankton, both competing for iron. Here, we dissect the demand component of the ferrous wheel by separately assessing iron uptake by heterotrophic bacteria and photoautotrophic picophytoplankton. To explore the seasonal and depth-related variability in iron uptake, the influence of light on iron uptake in both bacterial and phytoplankton communities was examined. We observed that picoeukaryote phytoplankton demonstrated iron uptake rates 10 times greater than those observed in bacteria when normalized to biomass. Light was shown to stimulate iron uptake by 8- to 16-fold in phytoplankton and by 4- to 8-fold in heterotrophic bacteria. These results highlight the unexpectedly significant role of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton in driving the speed of the ferrous wheel, with implications for iron recycling across diurnal cycles, different oceanic depths, and seasonally.</span>"

A large number of rare taxa in the community have not been excluded by abundant taxa with competitive advantages, a contradiction known as the biodiversity paradox. Recently, increasing evidence has revealed the central importance of antimicrobial toxins as crucial weapons of antagonism in microbial survival. The powerful effects of antimicrobial toxins result in simple combinations of microorganisms failing to coexist under laboratory conditions, but it is unclear whether they also have a negative impact on the biodiversity of natural communities. Here, we revealed that microbial communities worldwide universally possess functional potential for antimicrobial toxin production. Counterintuitively, the biodiversity of global microbial communities increases, rather than decreases, as the abundance of antimicrobial toxins in rare taxa rises. Rare taxa may encode more antimicrobial toxins than abundant taxa, which is associated with the maintenance of the high biodiversity of microbial communities amid complex interactions. Our findings suggest that the antagonistic interaction caused by antimicrobial toxins may play a positive role in microbial community biodiversity at the global scale.</span>"

Plants may adapt or migrate to resist global change, but this can lag behind rapid anthropogenic changes to the environment. Our data show that natural modulations of the microbiome of grassland plants in response to experimental land-use change in a common garden directly affect plant phenotype and performance, thus increasing plant tolerance. In contrast, direct effects of fertilizer application and mowing on plant phenotypes were less strong. Land-use intensity-specific microbiomes caused clearly distinguishable plant phenotypes also in a laboratory experiment using gnotobiotic strawberry plants in absence of environmental variation. Therefore, natural modulations of the plant microbiome may be key to species persistence and ecosystem stability. We argue that a prerequisite for this microbiome-mediated tolerance is the availability of diverse local sources of microorganisms facilitating rapid modulations in response to change. Thus, conservation efforts must protect microbial diversity, which can help mitigate the effects of global change and facilitate environmental and human health.</span>"

The host and phage each carried one chitinase gene, which differed from each other, suggesting that chitin degradation plays a role in their substrate supply. We demonstrated that prophage-encoded chitinase supported host chitin degradation and growth in the presence of chitin. Furthermore, prophage induction dynamics were strongly substrate-dependent, suggesting that the host controls the lysis-lysogeny switch in response to the presence of chitin, thus optimizing the trade-off between the loss of cells from prophage induction and prophage enhancement of host performance.

Legacies may result if historical climate differences alter the traits of soil microbial communities, particularly those associated with carbon cycling and stress tolerance. However, it is also possible that contemporary conditions can overcome the influence of historical climate, particularly under extreme conditions. Using shotgun metagenomics, we assessed the composition of soil microbial functional genes across a mean annual precipitation gradient that previously showed evidence of strong climate legacies in soil carbon flux and extracellular enzyme activity. Sampling coincided with recovery from a regional, multi-year severe drought, allowing us to document how the strength of climate legacies varied with contemporary conditions. We found increased investment in genes associated with resource cycling with historically higher precipitation across the gradient, particularly in traits related to resource transport and complex carbon degradation. This legacy effect was strongest in seasons with the lowest soil moisture, suggesting that contemporary conditions\u2014particularly, resource stress under water limitation\u2014influences the strength of legacy effects.

Understanding the factors that drive the stability and persistence of mutualism has become increasingly important in light of global change. Although dispersal is widely recognized as a crucial spatially explicit process in maintaining biodiversity and community structure, knowledge about how the dispersal of mutualists contributes to the persistence of mutualistic systems remains limited. In this study, we used a synthetic mutualism formed by genetically modified budding yeast to investigate the effect of dispersal on the persistence and stability of mutualisms under exploitation. We found that dispersal increased the persistence of exploited mutualisms by 80% compared to the isolated systems. Furthermore, our results showed that dispersal increased local diversity, decreased beta diversity among local communities, and stabilized community structure at the regional scale. Our results indicate that dispersal can allow mutualisms to persist in meta-communities by reintroducing species that are locally competitively excluded by exploiters. With limited dispersal, e.g. due to increased fragmentation of meta-communities, mutualisms might be more prone to breakdown.

Multiple samples were collected from two springs over several years to generate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. Metagenome-assembled genomes comprised 71 taxa (in 19 different phyla), of which 12 core taxa were present at high abundance in both springs.

The two abundant heterotrophs exhibit starkly different peak timing of expression, which we propose is shaped by their metabolic and genomic potential to use carbon sources that become differentially available during the diel cycle.

In the human oral microbiota, T9SS-driven gliding bacteria transport non-motile microbes and bacteriophages as cargo, thereby influencing the spatial organization and structural complexity of these polymicrobial communities. However, the physical rules governing the dispersal of T9SS-driven bacterial swarms are barely understood. Here, we collected time-lapse images, under anaerobic conditions, of developing swarms of a T9SS-driven microbe common to the human oral microbiota. Tracking of swarms revealed that small peripheral flares emerging from a colony develop structures that resemble fireworks displaying a chrysanthemum effect and flower-like patterns that convert to wave-like patterns and which further evolve into scattered microcolonies. Particle-image velocimetry showed density-dependent phase transitions and initial vorticity within these emerging patterns. Numerical simulations demonstrate that these patterns arise due to changes in swarm speed and alignment strength. Our data reveal a strategy used by an anaerobic swarming bacterium to control swarm behavior, resulting in scattered microcolonies distant from the mother colony, thus reducing competition for resources among colony members. This might ensure species survival even if conditions change drastically in one location of the human oral cavity.</span>"

Here, we investigated how the intestinal microbiota responds to fructans with varying degrees of polymerization in the context of gut dysbiosis. Both low molecular weight fructo-oligosaccharides and high molecular weight levan suppressed intestinal inflammation in a colitis mouse model, mitigating intestinal fibrosis and dysbiosis. Although both the effects of fructo-oligosaccharides and levan are microbiota-dependent, distinct modulation patterns of the intestinal microbiota were observed based on the molecular weight of the fructans.

Here, we tracked growth of individual <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Escherichia coli</span> cells in populations under fluctuating nutrient conditions.

Resuming high-nutrient inflow after low-nutrient conditions resulted in cells resuming growth and division, but with different lag times and leading to varying progeny. The history of cell growth during low-nutrient but not high-nutrient conditions was determinant for resumption of growth, which cellular genealogy analysis suggested to originate from inherited physiological differences. Our results demonstrate that cellular growth dynamics become diverse by nutrient limitations, under which a fraction of cells experienced a particular growth history can reproduce progeny with new resources in the future.</span>"

Most microbial habitats are not spatially continuous and well-mixed, but rather composed, at the microscale, of many isolated or semi-isolated local patches of different sizes, resulting in partitioning of microbial populations into discrete local populations. The impact of this spatial fragmentation on population dynamics is not well-understood. Here, we study how such variably sized micro-habitat patches affect the growth dynamics of clonal microbial populations and how dynamics in individual patches dictate those of the metapopulation. To investigate this, we developed the \u03bc-SPLASH, an ecology-on-a-chip platform, enabling the culture of microbes in microscopic landscapes comprised of thousands of microdroplets, with a wide range of sizes. Using the \u03bc-SPLASH, we cultured the model bacteria <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Escherichia coli</span> and based on time-lapse microscopy, analyzed the population dynamics within thousands of individual droplets. Our results reveal that growth curves substantially vary with droplet size. Although growth rates generally increase with drop size, reproductive success and the time to approach carrying capacity, display non-monotonic patterns. Combining \u03bc-SPLASH experiments with computational modeling, we show that these patterns result from both stochastic and deterministic processes, and demonstrate the roles of initial population density, patchiness, and patch size distribution in dictating the local and metapopulation dynamics. This study reveals basic principles that elucidate the effects of habitat fragmentation and population partitioning on microbial population dynamics. These insights deepen our understanding of natural microbial communities and have significant implications for microbiome engineering.</span>"

Predictive functional modeling on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data recapitulated in shotgun sequencing data revealed increased microbial central metabolism, lipolytic fermentation, and cross-feeding in the small intestine, whereas butyrate synthesis was colon-enriched. Neuroactive compound metabolism also demonstrated regional specificity, including small intestine-enriched gamma-aminobutyric acid degradation and colon-enriched tryptophan degradation. Specifically, the jejunum and ileum stood out as sites with high predicted metabolic and neuromodulation activity. Differences between luminal and mucosal microbiomes within each site of the gastrointestinal tract were largely facility-specific, though there were a few consistent patterns in microbial metabolism in specific pathogen-free mice. These included luminal enrichment of central metabolism and cross-feeding within both the small intestine and the colon, and mucosal enrichment of butyrate synthesis within the colon. Across three cohorts of germ-free mice colonized with mice or human stool, compositional and functional region specificity were inconsistently reproduced.

We used single-cell 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to reveal symbiont identity and mapped the symbiosis on a phylogeny time-calibrated by fossil data.

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The gut microbiota has evolved in a complex, spatially structured environment, where microbial interactions are shaped by host-secreted molecules. We propose the spatial sensing (SS) hypothesis, which posits that gut microbes regulate costly cooperative traits, such as public goods, based on their proximity to the epithelial layer. First, we explore the evolutionary dynamics and selective pressures that could drive the emergence of SS. We then outline the spatial organization of the gut microbiota, emphasizing diffusion gradients of host-secreted molecules that may serve as positional cues. Depending on the cost\u2013benefit ratio of secreting public goods near the epithelium, we propose two SS regulatory strategies: SS Type I, where production is suppressed in high-cost, low-benefit conditions, and SS Type II, where production is upregulated in nutrient-rich regions where benefits outweigh costs. We evaluate these strategies using an individual-based model simulating microbial competition in the gut environment. Our results show that SS regulation enhances microbial fitness by modulating investment in costly traits according to spatially varying costs and benefits, outperforming constitutive production. Our findings highlight that SS is both beneficial and evolutionarily feasible, as host-secreted molecules create spatial gradients that microbes can exploit for regulatory purposes. By incorporating spatial positioning as an additional regulatory cue, SS could complement quorum sensing (QS) and competition sensing (CS), fine-tuning the expression of costly traits when and where they are most beneficial within the gut environment. This perspective offers new insights into host\u2013microbiota interactions and could inform strategies for modulating gut microbiomes in health and disease.</span>"

    "content": "Abstract\nSoil microbial biomass (SMB) and stoichiometric ratios of carbon and nutrients in microorganisms are crucial to predict biogeochemical and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly under global change. Using SMB data from 1,288 studies in China, we mapped the distribution of microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN), and phosphorus (MBP) and their stoichiometric ratios using the random forest model. The stocks of MBC, MBN, and MBP in the topsoil (0\u201330\u00a0cm) were 9703701250 ${970}_{370}^{1250}$ (mean with 25% and 75% quantiles), 15054193 ${150}_{54}^{193}$, and 601774 ${60}_{17}^{74}$ Tg, respectively; the corresponding stocks in the subsoil (30\u2013100\u00a0cm) were 650410850 ${650}_{410}^{850}$ Tg\u00a0C, 12050160 ${120}_{50}^{160}$ Tg\u00a0N, and 652483 ${65}_{24}^{83}$ Tg P, respectively. The mean MBC/MBN, MBC/MBP, and MBN/MBP ratios in the topsoil were estimated to be 10, 29, and 3.9, respectively, and the corresponding ratios in the subsoil were 8.6, 19, and 2.5, respectively. Soil physico\u2010chemical properties (pH and moisture) are the main direct drivers of SMB and their stoichiometric ratios, while climate (temperature) indirectly affects SMB. Climate indirectly affects SMB by altering soil moisture and substrate availability, the physico\u2010chemical properties directly shape SMB content through habitat and resource constraints. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 demonstrated that SMB stocks will increase until 2,100. Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5\u20138.5, SMB stocks increased, especially in the topsoil. Our study clarified SMB stocks and microbial stoichiometric ratios for soils up to 1.0\u00a0m depth and revealed the main drivers. We assessed SMB density and microbial stoichiometric ratios, compiled databases across climatic regions, and provided recommendations for regional C, N, and P management."

To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating in vitro synergistic anti-<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Helicobacter pylori</span> activity between engineered enzybiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Results demonstrated that AB469 exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM (3.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), significantly outperforming Lysozyme (1.3\u00a0\u03bcM/19.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), Ply187 (1.4\u00a0\u03bcM/25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), S16 (3.3\u00a0\u03bcM/8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), and Nisin (3.6\u00a0\u03bcM/12.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Synergistic assays revealed that the combination of AB469 and Lysozyme achieved the most potent synergy (FIC index\u00a0=\u00a00.249), reducing their MICs by 8-fold each. Similarly, S16 and Lysozyme showed synergistic effects (FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.249), with MICs reduced by 8-fold. In contrast, Nisin combined with AB469 or Lysozyme displayed indifferent effects (FIC\u00a0=\u00a02.0). Additionally, outer membrane permeabilizers (EDTA-2Na, lactoferrin, and citric acid) significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity of AB469 and Lysozyme. For example, EDTA-2Na, lactoferrin, and citric acid reduced AB469\u2019s MIC by 16-fold, 8-fold, and 16-fold, respectively. This study highlights a dual-targeting strategy combining peptidoglycan degradation and outer membrane disruption, providing critical insights for combating drug-resistant <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Helicobacter pylori</span>.</span>"

The impact of vermicompost, a fermentation product of manure, on soil fungistasis and colonization of the nematophagous fungus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arthrobotrys oligospora</span> was explored in this study. It was found that amending soil with 10% or more vermicompost significantly and persistently enhances soil fungistatic intensity against <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. oligospora</span>. Similar effects were observed with ordinary compost. Neither plant presence (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Panax notoginseng</span> or tomato) nor earthworms significantly altered soil fungistasis. Microbiome and metabolome analyses revealed that vermicompost amendment reshaped bacterial communities and metabolite profiles, correlating with enhanced fungistasis. Further results showed that vermicompost amendment less than 10% showed no significant negative impact on soil colonization of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. oligospora</span>, but higher vermicompost amendment (20%) reduced <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. oligospora</span> soil colonization by approximately 34%. These findings suggest that manure amendment has potential negative impact on biocontrol fungi, and field-specific dosage of manure need to be optimized when integrating manure amendments with fungal biocontrol strategies.</span>"

    "content": "Abstract\nThe storm surge contribution to extreme sea levels along the European coastlines is investigated using hydrodynamic numerical simulations forced by atmospheric pressure and surface winds from a large ensemble of initialized climate models from the Decadal Climate Prediction Project experiment. The outputs, representative of the climate since 1960, amount for a total of > ${ >} $8,000\u00a0years of data, thus increasing significantly the sampling size of extreme simulated events compared to typical decadal\u2010long hydrodynamic hindcasts. The extended DCPP\u2010forced storm surge data set, once bias\u2010corrected, provides information on the probability of storm surges that are plausible in Europe in the current climate but for which there is no observational evidence. Our results show that these unprecedented extreme events are on average 20% larger than the observed maxima, with values reaching up to 1\u00a0m. The new data set\u00a0also enables the uncertainties in the probabilities to be constrained significantly (e.g., up to two orders of magnitude for 500\u2010year return periods). This permits a more robust quantification of coastal hazards and risks, particularly for the most extreme events with return periods that are substantially longer that the observational records."

This study addresses this limitation by estimating spatially and temporally varying parameters in the Regulated Ecosystem Model 2 (REcoM2) through the assimilation of satellite\u2010derived chlorophyll\u2010a data using an ensemble Kalman filter. Nine key BGC parameters were optimized, significantly improving the model's performance. Utilizing the optimized parameters in the model results in a 26% reduction in root mean square error for surface chlorophyll\u2010a concentrations compared to simulations with uniform parameters, with the spatial patterns of parameter estimates aligning well with observed distributions. These findings underscore the benefits of incorporating spatially and temporally varying parameters for enhancing model accuracy and understanding BGC variability."

    "content": "Abstract\nLandslide\u2010generated tsunamis represent a significant hazard, specifically in coastal, fjord, and lake environments. The accurate modeling of these complicated phenomena is crucial for risk assessment and preparation of mitigation strategies. Landslide\u2010generated tsunamis can be modeled using either three\u2010dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics or depth\u2010integrated two\u2010dimensional (2D) numerical models. 3D models are valuable for the modeling in the near\u2010field, however their computational cost is often prohibitive for simulating long\u2010range wave propagation (far\u2010field). 2D models are very efficient for simulating tsunami propagation over large areas, but cannot capture the full complexity of the generation process. In this paper, we propose a coupling strategy between 3D and 2D models for simulating tsunamis induced by granular landslides in complex geometries. Thus, it aims at maximizing near\u2010field accuracy while minimizing computational costs, thereby enabling efficient far\u2010field wave propagation. This strategy involves using the 3D model (OpenFOAM\u00ae) where nonlinear and confinement effects are dominant and feeding the 2D model (Mild Slope Equation) where the waves can efficiently be handled by such simplified tool. This model chain has been applied to the 2015 Taan Fiord, Alaska (USA), landslide\u2010tsunami event, a complex and well\u2010documented case, with extensive field data available. Beyond evaluating its performance for this specific event, the broader aim is to provide some general insights and practical guidance for the application of this modeling chain to landslide\u2010tsunami events. To this end, a sensitivity analysis, by varying the position of the coupling boundary between the two models, is also presented and discussed."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe mechanisms coupling typhoons with nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, have gained increasing significance under global climate change. This study investigates the N2O biogeochemical responses to Typhoon Yagi in the western Guangdong coastal waters (WGCW) by integrating analyses of nitrogen isotopes (\u03b415Nbulk\u2010N2O), oxygen isotopes (\u03b418O\u2010N2O), intramolecular 15N site preference (SP), and ancillary biogeochemical parameters. Post\u2010typhoon data revealed a pronounced decline in SP values, followed by a gradual enrichment of SP, \u03b415Nbulk\u2010N2O, and \u03b418O\u2010N2O over the time series sampling. These phenomena indicated that typhoon disturbance shifted the dominant nitrogen cycling processes from nitrification to denitrification which involved significant N2O reduction and consumption, likely driven by particulate matter inputs and subsequent degradation. Additionally, although a two\u2010layer model indicated a substantial atmospheric N2O influx into the marine environment across the air\u2010sea interface, N2O concentrations remained stable in the WGCW after the typhoon. This stability was accompanied by the concurrent decoupling of \u03b418O versus \u03b415N\u03b1, \u03b418O versus \u03b415Nbulk, and \u03b418O versus SP correlations, supporting the occurrence of high N2O reduction rates during denitrification which maintained stable N2O concentrations after the typhoon. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of different marine environments revealed distinct N2O dynamics following typhoons: enclosed bay tends to become significant atmospheric N2O sources, while the open ocean primarily acts as a sink. These findings suggest a negative feedback mechanism in which open ocean typhoon events enhance denitrification, potentially mitigating atmospheric N2O accumulation."

    "content": "Abstract\nField observations are often inadequate and numerical simulations are not sufficiently accurate for determining carbon source\u2013sink trends in estuaries, particularly those in frontal zones. To address these challenges, herein, we develop a carbon assimilation model that integrates the advantages of the total alkalinity diagnostic formula from field survey data, high\u2010accuracy partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) from remote sensing data, and representations of near\u2010coast and frontal carbon processes from a FVCOM\u2013NPZC model. In the regions between the 15 and 30 isohalines on the East China Sea shelf, the Changjiang River plume converges with offshore high\u2010salinity waters, thereby forming a typical frontal zone of a mid\u2010latitude estuary. This model captures pCO2 and air\u2013sea CO2 flux trends in the frontal zone along with their underlying mechanisms. The frontal zone exhibits a unique pCO2 decreasing trend, thus forming a spatial \u201cincreasing\u2013decreasing\u2013increasing\u201d structure in the near\u2010coast, frontal, and offshore areas. The unique decreasing trend in the frontal zone shows a three\u2010branched structure, which is associated with the reduction in the plume\u2019s expansion pathways. A rapid carbon source\u2013sink trend (\u22120.28\u00a0mmol/m2/d/y) is observed in the frontal zone, which is considerably faster than the increasing sink trend (\u22120.10\u00a0mmol/m2/d/y) in the offshore area. Enhanced shoreward wind and increased chlorophyll a concentration contribute to the pCO2 decreasing trend and the rapid carbon source\u2013sink trend in the frontal zone. The enhanced shoreward wind in the estuary increases salinity and total alkalinity, ultimately decreasing pCO2 levels. Enhanced phytoplankton growth in the frontal zone decreases both dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and pCO2 levels."

    "content": "Abstract\nIn this study, we describe in situ measurements of internal waves (IWs) in the Vilkitsky Strait, which connects the Kara and Laptev Seas in the Arctic Ocean. The measurements were conducted at three moorings over three weeks in autumn 2019 and demonstrated the presence of highly intense IWs. Although the study region is located poleward of the M2 critical latitude (74.5\u00b0N) for linear IWs, the measurements revealed the presence of semidiurnal ITWs with periods near 12.4\u00a0hr. The vertical displacements of isotherms caused by semidiurnal internal tides reached 10\u201317\u00a0m. In the coastal zone, the shape of ITWs differs significantly from a sinusoidal form due to pronounced nonlinear effects at shallow depths. Field observations clearly show the generation of high\u2010frequency IWs during the propagation of internal tides, as confirmed by the spectral analysis of temperature and isotherm displacement data. Joint analysis of in situ and synthetic aperture radar satellite observations reveals the regular occurrence of intense nonlinear high\u2010frequency IWs with phase velocities of 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0m/s, ranked wavelengths of 100\u2013600\u00a0m, periods of 5\u2013120\u00a0min, and amplitudes of 4\u201320\u00a0m. The predominant propagation direction of nonlinear IWs is along the strait aligned with the tidal currents. However, satellite data also indicate the occurrence of cross\u2010strait propagating IWs, potentially implying various source regions and mechanisms of their generation in the strait. Additionally, an episode of the second mode IWs was identified."

    "content": "Abstract\nSex differences are predicted to play an important role in the spread and evolution of pathogens. However, attempts to generalize the \u201csicker\u201d sex have been challenged by intraspecific variability of sex biases across the infection process. Sex\u2010specific plasticity provides a framework to resolve this by elucidating how infection is shaped at the sex\u2010pathogen\u2010environment interface. Using the Daphnia magna and Pasteuria ramosa system, we measure infection outcomes for males and females across three temperatures and seven pathogen densities to quantify how sex\u2010specific plasticity shapes susceptibility, pathogen loads, and ultimately transmission. We find unique forms of plasticity at each stage of infection \u2013 including equivalent, sex\u2010specific, and divergent plasticity. Integrating these into a single estimate of transmission reveals a clear pattern\u2014male\u2010biased transmission at cold temperatures, and female\u2010biased transmission at warm temperatures. Sex\u2010specific thermal plasticity can thus determine the \u201csicker\u201d sex, with implications for pathogen spread and evolution in a warming world."

    "content": "Abstract\nBiological systems face multiple stressors that impact biodiversity and ecosystem functions, with complex interactions that vary spatially and temporally leading to unpredictable outcomes. In freshwater ecosystems, benthic microbial communities underpin vital functions like decomposition and primary productivity, but are threatened by stressors such as salinization and nutrient enrichment, which are intensifying and increasingly co\u2010occurring due to climate change. We experimentally tested how stressor repetition and different orders of stressor exposure affect freshwater benthic microbial community responses over time. Communities established on tiles in 1000\u2009L open freshwater ponds established more than 10\u2009years ago in the field were exposed to elevated salinity and nutrient enrichment, either once or repeatedly, independently or in combination, and under different orders. Repeated exposure to nutrient enrichment led to stronger functional changes than the single exposure, while repeated exposure to elevated salinity resulted in weaker changes compared to a single exposure. Critically, we found that the sequence in which stressors occurred was a major determinant of microbial responses, driving interaction outcomes in opposing directions. When exposure to nutrient enrichment preceded elevated salinity, gross primary productivity was halved and carbon metabolic rates increased by 50% compared to communities treated in the reverse order. This study is among the first in a complex, outdoor freshwater system to demonstrate that stressor sequence can strongly shape multiple stressor effects, highlighting the order of stressor exposure as a key but often overlooked dimension of global change ecology. These findings suggest that microbial functions, including productivity and carbon cycling, will fluctuate more dramatically as stressors increasingly occur in different sequences under global change."

    "content": "<p>by Oluwatoyin Campbell, Dina Dahhan, Viviana Monje</p>\n\nProteins interact with lipid membranes to facilitate important cellular processes that underlie health and disease. Transmembrane proteins like ion channels are often composed of bound monomers forming specific contacts within the bilayer. However, molecular mechanisms of channel assembly are scarce. Understanding the role of lipids in this process may help further explain assembly of oligomeric proteins, which are often clinical drug targets. Using the hepatitis C virus p7 hexamer as a representative of proteins with complex transmembrane topology, this work characterizes early lipid-driven dimerization using molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing dimer interactions in aqueous solution versus on a lipid membrane model reveal that protein-lipid interactions critically guide inter-protein residue alignment and binding. Hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding between key residues and phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol lipids drive essential helix interactions that promote p7 oligomerization, particularly involving the first helix. This study demonstrates that membrane lipids are essential, dynamic contributors to protein binding and aggregation in cellular membranes."

Anderson, Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer</p>\n\nDengue virus (DENV) is an increasingly important human pathogen, with already half of the globe\u2019s population living in environments with transmission potential. Since many cases are missed by direct detection methods (RT-PCR or antigen tests), serological assays play an important role in the diagnostic process. However, individual assays can suffer from low sensitivity and specificity and interpreting results from multiple assays remains challenging, particularly because interpretations from multiple assays may differ, creating uncertainty over how to generate finalized interpretations. We develop a Bayesian mixture model that can jointly model data from multiple paired serological assays, to infer infection events. We first test the performance of our model using simulated data. We then apply our model to 677 pairs of acute and convalescent serum collected as a part of illness and household investigations across two longitudinal cohort studies in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, including data from 232 RT-PCR confirmed infections (gold standard). We compare the classification of the new model to prior standard interpretations that independently utilize information from either the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA). We find that additional serological assays improve accuracy of infection detection for both simulated and real world data. Models incorporating paired IgG and IgM data as well as those incorporating IgG, IgM, and HAI data consistently have higher accuracy when using PCR confirmed infections as a gold standard (87\u201390% F1 scores, a combined metric of sensitivity and specificity) than currently implemented cut-point approaches (82\u201384% F1 scores). Our results provide a probabilistic framework through which multiple serological assays across different platforms can be leveraged across sequential serum samples to provide insight into whether individuals have recently experienced a DENV infection. These methods are applicable to other pathogen systems where multiple serological assays can be leveraged to quantify infection history."

    "content": "<p>by August Guang, Casey W Dunn, Vlad Novitsky, Mark Howison, Rami Kantor</p>\n\nMolecular epidemiology and HIV-1 transmission networks reconstruction can provide insights into transmission dynamics and inform public health strategies. Long HIV sequences, such as near full-length (nFL) genomes, can improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inference. However, relatively short pol sequences are still broadly used for inferring molecular HIV clusters. Whether a mix of long and short HIV-1 sequences can improve phylogenetic inference of molecular HIV clusters remains unknown.\nWe propose a flexible approach called T-shaped alignments that incorporates both nFL HIV-1 genomes and partial pol sequences, and investigate whether this approach improves phylogenetic reconstruction of molecular clusters. Under the assumption that clustering from 100% of long sequences is the most accurate, we obtained 1196 subtype B nFL HIV-1 sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Database and a single-study subset, varied the proportion of long and short sequences in our T-shape alignments, systematically masked all non-pol regions with missing characters in proportional increments, and compared tree similarity and cluster inference among datasets.\nWith the full dataset, we found that when more than 50% of available sequences are nFL, the T-shaped alignment gradually yields results closer to the 100% n, with more and larger clusters identified. However, below the 50% threshold accuracy did not increase. Stringent bootstrap thresholds decreased cluster accuracy gaps but also decreased number of clusters found and mean cluster size. For the subset dataset, we found that the introduction of nFL sequences to the T-shaped alignment improves accuracy in clustering either after a 30% threshold or immediately depending on bootstrap choice.\nOur new approach and results suggest that using T-shape alignments to mix HIV-1 sequences of different lengths can improve phylogenetic and clustering accuracy, with needed nFL proportion depending on analysis goals. The T-shape alignment provides a straightforward method for utilizing all available sequences to improve phylogenetic analysis."

Although there has been progress in the development of multi-scale modeling tools, no comprehensive module for simulating rTMS-induced synaptic plasticity in biophysically realistic neurons exists.\nObjective: We developed a modelling framework that allows the replication and detailed prediction of long-term changes of excitatory synapses in neurons stimulated by rTMS.\nMethods: We implemented a voltage-dependent plasticity model that has been previously established for simulating frequency-, time-, and compartment-dependent spatio-temporal changes of excitatory synapses in neuronal dendrites. The plasticity model can be incorporated into biophysical neuronal models and coupled to electrical field simulations.\nResults: We show that the plasticity modelling framework replicates long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells evoked by 10-Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS). In line with previous experimental studies, this plasticity was strongly distance dependent and localised to the proximal synapses of the neuron. We predicted a decrease in the plasticity amplitude for 5 Hz and 1 Hz protocols with decreasing frequency. Finally, we successfully modelled plasticity in distal synapses upon local electrical theta-burst stimulation (TBS) and predicted proximal and distal plasticity for rMS TBS. Notably, the rMS TBS-evoked synaptic plasticity exhibited robust facilitation by dendritic spikes and low sensitivity to inhibitory suppression.\nConclusion: The plasticity modelling framework enables precise simulations of LTP-like cellular effects with high spatio-temporal resolution, enhancing the efficiency of parameter screening and the development of plasticity-inducing rTMS protocols."

    "content": "<p>by Fatemeh Keikha, Chuanyuan Wang, Zhixia Yang, Zhi-Ping Liu</p>\n\nThe identification of state specific biomarkers that reflect dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks is critical for understanding cancer progression and enhancing diagnostic precision. While multilayer network models have been proposed for analyzing disease evolution, most existing methods rely solely on topological features, neglecting structural rewiring and expression variability across disease states. In this study, we introduce TransMarker, a framework designed to detect genes with regulatory role transitions, those with meaningful shifts in regulatory roles during disease progression, as dynamic biomarkers via cross-state alignment of multi-state single-cell data. TransMarker encodes each disease state as a distinct layer in a multilayer graph, integrating prior interaction data with state-specific expression to construct attributed gene networks. Contextualized embeddings for each stage are generated for each state using Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and structural shifts are quantified via Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport. Genes with significant changes are ranked using a Dynamic Network Index (DNI), which captures their regulatory variability. These prioritized biomarkers are then applied in a deep neural network for disease state classification. We validate our approach on synthetic simulated and real world dataset of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), to evaluate performance across diverse scenarios and assess generalizability. TransMarker outperforms existing multilayer network ranking techniques in classification accuracy, robustness, and biomarker relevance. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each step to overall performance. Our findings suggest that combining regulatory rewiring, temporal expression dynamics, and cross-state alignment provides a powerful strategy for identifying biologically meaningful biomarkers and modeling disease progression at single cell resolution."

Particularly, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has gained importance in recent years thanks to the shorter waiting times and better graft quality than with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some patients experience graft loss due to unexpected infections, sepsis, or immune-mediated rejection of the transplanted organ. An urgent need exists to clarify which patients experience graft loss. Several models have been proposed, but most analyze the classic DDLT, and knowledge about LDLT is lacking. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 748 patients who underwent LDLT. By adapting machine learning methods, we predicted early graft loss (within 180 days postoperatively) with better performance than conventional models. The model enabled us to stratify a highly heterogeneous sample of patients into five groups. By focusing on survival time, we next categorized the patients into three groups with early, intermediate, and late or no graft loss. Notably, we identified the intermediate-loss group as a distinct population similar to the early-loss population but with different survival times. Additionally, by proposing a hierarchical prediction method, we developed an approach to distinguish these populations using data up to 30 days postoperatively. Our findings will enable the early identification of individuals at risk of graft loss, particularly those in the early- and intermediate-loss groups. This will allow for appropriate patient care, such as switching to DDLT, identifying other living donors for LDLT, or preparing for re-transplantation, leading to a bottom-up improvement in transplant success rates."

We tested horizontal FL architectures employing Logistic Regression (LR) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via parameter aggregation, alongside a novel Federated Random Forest (RF) using ensemble aggregation. Performance gain (<i>\u0394</i>AUC, calculated as AUC\u2000federated minus AUC\u2000local) was quantified using bootstrap analysis to determine 95% confidence intervals.

Crucially, the gain\u2019s magnitude and statistical significance showed a strong inverse correlation with local patient volume (N). Substantial and statistically significant gains concentrated in data-limited institutions (N < 500). For example, the smallest hospital (N=86) achieved a remarkable <i>\u0394</i>AUC of 0.3682 (95% CI [0.0908, 0.6307]) with the RF model. However, interpreting these benefits requires caution because the 95% CIs for <i>\u0394</i>AUC crossed zero for the majority of hospitals, suggesting the collaborative model\u2019s statistical advantage is not universally certain at every site. This trade-off was particularly evident with the MLP model which, despite achieving the highest average <i>\u0394</i>AUC, was the most volatile algorithm, registering the maximum performance degradation in the network (<i>\u0394</i>AUC = \u20130.0884, 95% CI [\u20130.1527, \u20130.0273]) due to its high sensitivity to local data distribution disparities (non-IID). This study validates FL as an equity-enabling mechanism that effectively enhances predictive capacity where local data scarcity is highest. Our findings underscore that maximizing the most statistically certain benefits of FL requires continuous monitoring and local validation for successful clinical deployment across diverse settings."

Victor Makota, Giel G. van Dooren</p>\n\nThe assembly of iron\u2013sulfur (FeS) clusters for cytosolic and nuclear proteins is essential for eukaryotic cell biology. This assembly is mediated by the Cytosolic Iron\u2013sulfur Assembly (CIA) pathway, which localizes to the cytosol of most eukaryotes. We showed previously that the scaffold protein on which cytosolic FeS clusters assemble localizes to the mitochondrion of the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. The localization and importance of the remainder of the pathway in these parasites, however, remained unclear. Here, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the CIA pathway in <i>T. gondii</i> parasites. We present evidence that the CIA pathway localizes predominantly to the mitochondrion of the parasite and is essential for parasite survival. We show that the three proteins that make up the CIA Targeting Complex (CTC), which facilitates the transfer of FeS clusters to cytosolic and nuclear client proteins, exhibit dual localization to the mitochondrion and cytosol. We reveal that mitochondrial targeting of the CTC is mediated by a novel loop on the CIA1 protein of the complex, and that this loop is critical for parasite survival. We show that an aromatic amino acid motif in the loop facilitates mitochondrial targeting, and that this loop is functionally conserved in apicomplexans and their closest free-living relatives. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the CIA pathway in an important group of intracellular parasites, and elucidates pivotal differences in an otherwise ancient and highly conserved biosynthetic pathway that may reflect an evolutionary fitness advantage conferred on <i>Toxoplasma</i> and related organisms."

    "content": "<p>by Lilia Kukovska, Katharina A. Wilmes, Natsumi Y. Homma, Claudia Clopath, Jasper Poort</p>\n\nInhibition is critical for balanced cortical activity and learning. Parvalbumin-expressing cells (PV) are the most common cortical inhibitory interneurons. Strong PV activation inactivates cortical regions. However, the effect of moderate activation on vision and dependence on activation strength, timing, and task difficulty is not established. We investigated these three major factors during visual discriminations in mice. Moderate PV activation in the primary visual cortex (V1) improved easy but not difficult discriminations. It did so only during the initial 120\u2009ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the initial feedforward processing sweep. Both easy and difficult discriminations required undisturbed late phase activity beyond 120\u2009ms, highlighting the importance of sustained V1 activity. Combined optogenetic activation and two-photon imaging showed that behavioral effects were associated with V1 response selectivity changes. A circuit model with nonlinear activation and strong competitive interactions between V1 cells captured the data. This demonstrates that early and sustained V1 activity is crucial for perceptual discrimination and delineates conditions when PV activation shapes neuronal selectivity to improve behavior."

A landmark event during early development is the lytic dismantling of the substrate mycelium. Degradation of the hyphal cell-wall leads to the accumulation of <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the colonies, which is a metabolic checkpoint during the onset of development and antibiotic production. Here, we show that GlcNAc sensing requires a toxicity pathway dependent on the enzyme GlcNAc-6P dehydratase (NagS). Dehydration of GlcNAc-6P by NagS to 6P-chromogen I is an unprecedented reaction in central metabolism that is highly conserved in \u2013 and limited to \u2013 the <i>Streptomycetaceae</i>. 6P-chromogen I is metabolized into a structural analogue of ribose by a promiscuous activity of GlcNAc-6P deacetylase NagA. Toxicity is relieved by supplementing the growth media with ribose. Structure-function analysis of NagS not only highlighted key residues in the active site of the enzyme in interaction with its substrate GlcNAc-6P, but also revealed 6-phosphogluconate as its catalytic inhibitor. Our work uncovers a conserved metabolic toxicity pathway in <i>Streptomyces</i> that revolves around a novel enzyme that plays a key role in nutrient signaling."

Johnson</p>\n\nEpisodic memory depends on the coordination of local processing, indexed by high-frequency broadband (HFB) activity, with global organization, indexed by theta oscillations. However, theta and HFB exhibit asynchronous timing, raising the question of how results of local processing are communicated. Using intracranial EEG in patients performing a recognition memory task, we examined this coordination across medial temporal (MTL) and prefrontal (PFC) regions. HFB peaks occurred earlier in the MTL than in the PFC. Contrasting analyses were anchored either to these internally driven HFB peaks or to the external event of stimulus presentation. We discovered three key results. First, the role of the PFC changed from encoding to retrieval. Specifically, PFC-MTL theta connectivity was aligned with internal PFC peaks during encoding, suggesting top-down initiation. By contrast, this connection was aligned with external stimulus presentation during retrieval, suggesting bottom-up initiation. Second, the anterior cingulate cortex exhibited connectivity that was aligned to internal HFB peaks only, suggesting that its role is evaluative, devoid of direct stimulus processing. Third, graph theoretic analysis of whole-brain connectivity patterns revealed that the connections predicting successful memory performance were embedded in transient, sparse network states. These results reveal that analyses triggered from internally-generated events yield different results when compared to classic analyses triggered using external events. The picture that emerges is a sequence of specific, short-lived, internally-generated states that drive episodic memory success."

Significant interbrain information alignment emerged within 45\u2009ms of stimulus presentation and persisted for hundreds of milliseconds. Early alignment (45\u2013180\u2009ms) occurred in both real and randomly matched pseudo-pairs, reflecting shared sensory responses. Importantly, alignment after 200\u2009ms strengthened with practice and was unique to real pairs, driven by shared representations associated with, and extending beyond, the categorization rules they formed. Together, these findings highlight distinct processes underpinning interbrain information alignment during social interactions, that can be effectively captured and disentangled with Interbrain RSA."

In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, three of the four Type VII ABC systems have been extensively characterized, including: the FtsEX-EnvC cell division complex, the LolCDE-LolA lipoprotein trafficking machinery, and the MacAB-TolC efflux pump. Here we describe a fourth <i>E. coli</i> Type VII ABC system, YbbAP-TesA, which combines a Type VII ABC transporter with a multifunctional hydrolytic enzyme. Structures of the complete YbbAP-TesA complex, and of YbbAP with and without bound ATP analogues, capture implied long-range transmembrane conformational changes that are the hallmark of this ABC superfamily\u2019s mechanotransmission mechanism. We further show that YbbAP-TesA can hydrolyze a variety of ester and thioester substrates and experimentally confirm a constellation of active site residues in TesA. Our data suggests YbbAP has a role in extracting hydrophobic molecules from the inner membrane and presenting these to TesA for hydrolysis. The work extends collective knowledge of the remarkable diversity of the ABC superfamily and establishes a new function for Type VII ABC transporters in bacterial cells."

By leveraging advanced signal processing and data analysis techniques, spike sorting makes it possible to detect, isolate, and map single neuron spiking activity from both in vivo and in vitro extracellular electrophysiological recordings. A crucial step of any spike sorting pipeline is to reduce the dimensionality of the recorded spike waveform data. Reducing the dimensionality of the processed data is a near-universal practice, fundamentally motivated by the use of clustering algorithms responsible to detect, isolate, and sort the recorded putative neurons. In this paper, we propose and illustrate on both synthetic and experimental data that employing the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) can drastically improve the performance, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of spike sorting pipelines without increasing their computational cost. We show how replacing the linear or ad hoc, expert-defined, supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods commonly used in spike sorting pipelines by the unsupervised, mathematically grounded, nonlinear dimensionality reduction method provided by UMAP drastically increases the number of correctly sorted neurons, makes the identification of quieter, seldom spiking neurons more reliable, enables deeper and more precise explorations and analysis of the neural code, and paves new ways toward more efficient and end-to-end automatable spike sorting pipelines of large-scale extracellular neural recording as those produced by high-density multielectrode arrays."

In this study, we show that conditional knockdown of APP selectively in Purkinje cells (PCs) recapitulates these motor deficits, while exogenous expression of APP in APP-null mice rescues motor function. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that APP deficiency leads to aberrant firing patterns in PCs and reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission onto neurons of the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). We identified a marked reduction in Nav1.6-mediated sodium currents as the key mechanism underlying abnormal action potential firing and propagation in APP-deficient PCs. Importantly, all electrophysiological and behavioral deficits were rescued by PC-specific APP reconstitution. These findings reveal a novel and essential role for APP in cerebellar motor control by regulating Nav1.6 channel activity and PC excitability."

This organelle traverses the apical polar ring (APR) in response to calcium waves and plays a critical role in controlling parasite motility. While the actomyosin-dependent extrusion of the conoid is beginning to be elucidated, the mechanism by which it remains apically anchored to the APR is still unclear. RNG2, a protein localized to both the conoid and the APR, has emerged as a strong candidate for mediating this connection. Biochemical analysis revealed that RNG2 is an unstable protein, undergoing extensive proteolytic cleavage both in the parasite and in heterologous expression systems. Its biochemical properties, with the presence of large coiled-coil domains, likely facilitate the formation of concatenated assemblies, enabling RNG2 to serve as a dynamic and resilient bridge between the conoid and the APR. Using a combination of iterative ultrastructure expansion microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, we confirmed the localization of RNG2 to the 22 tethering elements bridging the APR and the conoid. Conditional depletion of RNG2 led to the striking detachment of the intact conoid organelle from the APR, supporting an essential role for RNG2 as a tether. Cryo-electron tomography of conoid-less parasites revealed that, in the absence of RNG2, the apical vesicle remains anchored to the plasma membrane, while the rhoptries follow the detached conoid. Although RNG2 depletion only mildly reduces microneme secretion, the parasites are immotile and exhibit impaired rhoptry discharge, highlighting the critical role of proper conoid anchorage in motility and host cell invasion. Comprehensive mutagenesis of RNG2 identified distinct regions responsible for binding to the conoid and the APR, and demonstrated that the full-length, intact protein is essential for bridging these two structures and for its functional activity. Altogether, RNG2 emerges as a pivotal protein that ensures conoid functionality and coordination in Coccidia."

In a melanoma mouse model induced by <i>BRaf</i><sup>CA</sup> mutation and <i>Pten</i>-deficiency, we observed that PLK1 overexpression mediated metabolic reprogramming to markedly accelerate tumor growth, promote metastasis, and shortened mice survival. Mechanistically, PLK1 stabilizes BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1), which serves as a crucial transcription factor for genes involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. Moreover, the PLK1/BACH1 axis confers resistance to Vemurafenib, a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor, in melanoma. In light of this finding, we attempted an innovative pharmacological combination targeting both BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and PLK1, identifying a synergistic efficiency to this approach to suppress tumor growth. Overall, we have discovered a novel function of PLK1 that is independent of the cell cycle, which could pave new ways for melanoma therapies."

Proximity labeling tools have been instrumental in identifying upstream or downstream effectors of specific proteins within signaling pathways. However, currently, there are no tools available to directly label and capture intermediary proteins that bridge two non-interacting proteins. Here, we developed Split-TurboID and PUP-IT based Protein Identification Tool (STUPPIT), a novel method combining split-TurboID and PUP-IT to biotinylate intermediary proteins of two non-interacting proteins through a two-step enzymatic reaction. STUPPIT was validated using three well-characterized protein triads, including YAP1/AMOT/\u03b2-actin, YAP1/LATS1/MOB1A, and \u03b2-catenin/\u03b1-catenin/\u03b2-actin using HEK293T human cell lines. Combining STUPPIT and proteomics, we identified novel intermediary proteins including ERC1 and USP7, which interacted both with \u03b2-catenin and SMAD4, key components of the Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. In conclusion, STUPPIT represents a powerful tool for labeling and capturing intermediary proteins between non-interacting partners, offering new insights into protein-protein interactions and advancing signal transduction research."

    "content": "Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) acts as an energy source, a toxin, and a gasotransmitter across diverse biological contexts. We use the robust locomotory responses of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to high levels of H<sub>2</sub>S to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its acute and adaptive responses. We find that the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked behavioral response is shaped by multiple environmental factors including oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels and nutritional state and is modulated by various pathways such as insulin, TGF-\u03b2, and HIF-1 signaling, as well as by input from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons. Prolonged exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S activates HIF-1 signaling, leading to the upregulation of stress-responsive genes, including those involved in H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification. This promotes an adaptive state in which locomotory speed is reduced in H<sub>2</sub>S, while responsiveness to other stimuli is preserved. In mutants deficient in HIF-1 signaling, iron storage, and detoxification mechanisms, animals display a robust initial response but rapidly enter a sleep-like behavior characterized by reduced mobility and diminished responsiveness to subsequent sensory stimuli. Furthermore, while acute production of mitochondria-derived reactive O<sub>2</sub> species (ROS) appears to initiate the avoidance response to H<sub>2</sub>S, persistently high ROS promotes an adaptive state, likely by activating various stress-response pathways, without substantially compromising cellular H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification capacity. Taken together, our study provides comprehensive molecular insights into the mechanisms through which <i>C. elegans</i> modulates and adapts its response to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure."

However, research on LMI in the South China Sea (SCS) is limited. Our study found a significant increase in LMI amplitude in the SCS since the 1980s. This change was driven by decreasing LMI of local TCs and increasing LMI of migratory TCs from the western North Pacific. Attribution analysis showed that a westward shift in local TC genesis increased land constraints, suppressed TC development, and weakened LMI. In contrast, the poleward migration of TC tracks facilitated the increased entry of storms into the SCS through the Luzon Strait with minimal land interaction, thereby enhancing the LMI of migratory TCs. Additionally, favorable environmental conditions increase the frequency of rapid intensification events, further boosting LMI. These changes suggest the growing potential impact of TCs on countries and regions surrounding the SCS."

However, many species\u2019 movements are difficult to reconstruct from available datasets, hampering conservation efforts. This is especially the case for aquatic species that rarely surface, for which data are often limited to observations from acoustic telemetry (detections) and ancillary sensors. Here, we pioneer the use of state-of-the-art particle algorithms to model movements, integrate datasets, and assess MPA design, leveraging a case study of a Critically Endangered elasmobranch. Our algorithms led to 5-fold improvements in space-use maps and 30-fold improvements in residency estimates compared to prevailing methods. By integrating tracking datasets, we were uniquely able to examine movements beyond acoustic receivers, MPA-scale residency, and specific habitats beyond protected areas that warrant protection. This work reveals a modeling framework that enhances the conservation value of acoustic telemetry, supporting analyses of MPA efficacy worldwide.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

While two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) US improve cancer detection, their low specificity leads to frequent unnecessary biopsies. Operator dependence on 2D US has led to the development of 3D automated breast volume scanners (ABVS), but challenges remain in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. We developed a 3D photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS)\u2013ABVS system that integrates a large field-of-view, 768-element transducer to improve diagnostic accuracy. In a clinical study of 61 patients with 36 benign and 30 malignant lesions, multispectral photoacoustic imaging was used to measure blood volume and oxygen saturation within lesions. When combined with standard US BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) scores, the system achieved a sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 66.7%. This performance matched the best outcomes of 2D PAUS and outperformed conventional US.

However, its performance is currently limited by the insufficient modulation of local alkalinity at a full cell level. In this work, we reveal that confining the in situ generated hydroxide at cathode and enriching the bulk hydroxide to anode are the key factors for an efficient carbon monoxide\u2013electroreduction full cell. We thereby propose a silica-confined strategy for electrocatalyst design to maintain high local alkalinity at both cathode and anode by the strong Lewis acid\u2013base interaction between highly electrophilic silicon atom and hydroxide. The developed copper/silica cathode and cobalt/silica anode successfully promote cathodic multicarbon formation and anodic oxygen evolution, thereby improving the full cell energy efficiency. Even under high-rate electrolysis at 900 milliamperes per square centimeter, the selectivity and energy efficiency of multicarbon products remain above 80 and 30%. This achievement highlights the significance of modulating the dynamic hydroxide transport at full cell in enhancing carbon monoxide electroreduction performance.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

However, the origin of this selectivity is not well understood, impeding the strategic optimization for methanol generation. Here, we show potential-modulated orbital interaction mechanisms governing the selectivity in hetero-CoPc based on first-principles calculations with consideration of carbon support and electrochemical interfaces. Specifically, constant-potential orbital-resolved analyses reveal that electrons introduced by applied potentials initially occupy the semi-occupied Co-3d\n    <sub>\n     z\n    </sub>\n    <sub>\n     <sup>\n      2\n     </sup>\n    </sub>\n    orbital, thus suppressing CO-5\u03c3 \u2192 Co-3d\n    <sub>\n     z\n    </sub>\n    <sub>\n     <sup>\n      2\n     </sup>\n    </sub>\n    electron donation. This induces gradual weakening of *CO adsorption while establishing high *CO hydrogenation barriers (restricting the product to CO) over the medium potential range. With further decreasing potentials, a progressive electron population occurs in the Co-3d\n    <sub>\n     yz\n    </sub>\n    /d\n    <sub>\n     xz\n    </sub>\n    orbitals, promoting the Co-3d\n    <sub>\n     xz\n    </sub>\n    /d\n    <sub>\n     yz\n    </sub>\n    \u2192 CO-2\u03c0* back-donation. This facilitates the activation of the C\u2500O bond of *CO, thereby reducing its hydrogenation barriers and enabling methanol production at more negative potentials. Similar analyses also rationalize experimental observations for other heterogenized metal phthalocyanines, showing the importance of potential-modulated orbital interactions for selectivity engineering.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Glossy visual effects defy that principle, because the bright, directional pulse of light that dominates their appearance is highly variable across space and time. Here, we investigate how dynamic light reflections influence signal efficacy using bumblebees as a model of insect vision and plant-pollinator interactions. We show that glossy floral signals occur across Angiosperm lineages. Through behavioral experiments with artificial stimuli that mimic the spectral and spatial reflectance properties of glossy and matte floral surfaces, we demonstrate that glossiness enhances long-range detectability but compromises fine-scale color discrimination at close range. Glossiness thus poses an optical property by which organisms can attune their visual appearance independent of pigmentary properties, representing a functional trade-off between conspicuousness and signal reliability.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Extracellular vesicles derived from injured brain tissue (TBI-EVs) may mediate brain-kidney interactions. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TBI-EVs causes AKI by promoting pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization. TBI-EVs markedly increased AKI markers and proportion of pro-inflammatory-polarized macrophages. Mechanistically, transcriptomics of TBI-EVs revealed high circUsp32 expression. Subsequent in vitro assays showed that circUsp32 competitively binds to the SH2 domain of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (Socs1), affecting interferon regulator factor 7 (IRF7) ubiquitination and promoting pro-inflammatory polarization. CircUsp32 knockdown reduced pro-inflammatory polarization and alleviated AKI in TBI mice. In addition, circUsp32 is homologous to hsa_circ_0044940, which may serve as a predicted biomarker of AKI after TBI. Notably, AKI following TBI may contribute to neuroinflammation via uremic toxins.

Eye tracking demonstrated that responses remained spatially selective despite gaze shifts altering retinal stimulus position. Thus, the turtle cortex encodes unexpected visual stimuli using computations invariant to retinal position, a property previously observed only in higher mammalian cortices.

Contrary to global trends, our findings suggest that heat vulnerability is increasing across African populations. Nighttime heatwave mortality risk increased significantly between 2005 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015 [OR from 1.02 (95% CI: 0.87 to 1.13) to 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.23)], while daytime heatwaves showed no significant impact.

The findings suggest that debate over the wisdom of forced restraint of behavior as a strategy to reduce deaths should reflect the likely divergent effects of such interventions on working-age men and women.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

    "content": "Abstract\nEarly diagenetic forward and reverse weathering reactions play a significant role in controlling alkalinity fluxes and silica, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cycling in coastal systems. In Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, the inputs of autochthonous biogenic debris (diatomaceous silica) and allochthonous lithogenic material of varying reactivity (dominated by clays, especially illite and chlorite, and primary aluminosilicates, mostly plagioclase) drive complex balances of diagenetic silicate reactions in sediments. The rapid dissolution of reactive silica results in the release of dissolved silica (Sid) into pore\u2010waters and sustains elevated benthic Sid fluxes (\u22120.2 to \u22120.8\u00a0mmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121), which are on the upper end of values previously determined for Arctic environments. Increases with depth in pore\u2010water lithium (Li+), potassium, magnesium, and barium concentrations within the top centimeters provided evidence for forward weathering of clays quickly upon burial. Due to the prevalent occurrence of forward weathering, the benthic net Li+ flux was associated with a light isotope signal. Decreases in pore\u2010water rubidium concentrations with depth at the near\u2010glacier station, elevated ratios of the authigenically altered silica to the biogenic silica pool at all sites, and small increases of pore\u2010water \u03b47Li values with depth showed that reverse weathering also takes place. Anoxic incubation of diatom frustule probes provided further evidence for the neoformation of cation\u2010rich clays. The superposition of reverse and forward weathering results in cryptic silica and cation cycling that muted net benthic fluxes. In deeper sediments, changes in pore\u2010water solute patterns indicated an interconnected occurrence of reverse and forward weathering, potentially driven by reactive silica\u2010limitation."

The SEIO decadal salinity variation contributed to over half the magnitude of decadal sea level variation in this region. Previous studies suggested several possible factors contributing to SEIO decadal salinity signal: SEIO local winds, remote winds in the tropical Pacific forcing the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) that advects salinity signal into the SEIO, SEIO local freshwater flux, remote freshwater flux over the Maritime Continent (MC). These studies did not agree on a key forcing mechanism. Here, we attribute decadal variation of SEIO salinity by isolating the contributions of freshwater and wind stress forcings through sensitivity experiments using the ocean modeling and state estimation system of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project. Our causality analysis reveals that Maritime Continent surface freshwater flux is the key for decadal variation of SEIO salinity. Decadal variation in local or remote winds and SEIO local freshwater flux, implicated to be important by some previous studies, play little role. Salt budget analysis suggests that the advection of the salinity gradient, induced by the decadal variation of freshwater content over the MC, into the SEIO is the main oceanic process transmitting the MC water cycle effect to the SEIO."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nTropical Asia's complex, dynamic geological and climatic history, coupled with its diverse topography, provides a fascinating setting to study evolutionary processes driving high biodiversity. This phylogenomic research reconstructs the evolutionary history of the strictly arboreal and forest\u2010dependent Oriental Giant Squirrels (Ratufa) to gain insights into the interplay between paleo\u2010forest distribution and regional diversification. By analysing genomic data (complete mitochondrial genomes and approximately 4000 nuclear ultraconserved elements) from historic museum specimens and conducting divergence time estimation and niche modelling, we uncover how global paleoclimate cooling, the uplift of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, and habitat fragmentation led to allopatric speciation in refugia during the mid\u2010Miocene, Miocene\u2013Pliocene boundary, and late Pliocene, in synchrony with other evergreen forest\u2010dependent species. Our findings underscore the potential role of grassland expansion during climatic oscillations and the North Sunda and Mekong paleorivers in isolating populations and promoting vicariance and speciation in this region. This research suggests a species\u2010level diversity underestimation within R. bicolor and R. affinis, supporting the recognition of R. gigantea as a distinct species, along with several candidate species that warrant integrative taxonomic revision. Additionally, this study highlights the rapid and independent evolution of dwarfism in three Ratufa lineages and discusses challenges in museum genomics. Ultimately, this study serves as a valuable reference on the historical biogeography of tropical Asia, providing important insights for the conservation of these threatened taxa and the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain biodiversity in this hyperdiverse region."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe central\u2013marginal hypothesis (CMH) predicts reduced genetic diversity and increased differentiation in range\u2010edge populations due to ecological marginality and limited gene flow. Deviations from this pattern, however, can result from historical demographic processes, variation in reproductive strategies or interspecific hybridization. The genus Quercus, known for hybridization and long\u2010distance pollination, offers an excellent model to examine the spatial patterns of genetic diversity, structure and introgression across species distributions. Here, we investigate these dynamics in Quercus bicolor Willd., a widespread eastern North American oak. Using RADseq, we genotyped 142 individuals from 12 sites at the fragmented trailing range edge and nine sites from the range core. To detect introgression, we incorporated reference data from six sympatric white oak species. We reveal extensive introgression, particularly from Q. lyrata Walt., in nearly all southern edge populations, but none in core populations despite sympatry with closely related congeners. Southern populations also showed increased genetic structure and differentiation, but not reduced diversity or increased inbreeding, even when only examining non\u2010admixed individuals. Regression analyses reveal relationships between introgressed ancestry and heterozygosity, inbreeding and differentiation, indicating that introgression may buffer range\u2010edge populations against genetic erosion by introducing novel alleles. Hindcast, current and forecast ecological niche models demonstrate temporally changing degrees of overlap between the geographic range of Q. lyrata and Q. bicolor and suggest higher hybridization potential in the future. These findings offer mixed support for the CMH while underscoring the evolutionary relevance of introgression in shaping genetic landscapes at range margins with significant implications for conservation."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nHuman disturbance can have profound effects on biodiversity, including increasing hybridization between reproductively isolated species. One approach for understanding how human activity affects hybridization dynamics is to evaluate correlations between disturbance (e.g., urbanisation, temperature change) and hybridization. Because variation in hybridization can also arise from historical factors unrelated to recent human disturbance, it is essential to account for population structure to avoid spurious correlations. Here, we combine environmental and high\u2010coverage whole\u2010genome resequencing data to investigate how human disturbance and population structure affect hybridization dynamics between a pair of pine sawflies adapted to different pines, Neodiprion lecontei and Neodiprion pinetum. We find that N. lecontei and N. pinetum exhibit strikingly different patterns of population structure, which we hypothesise stem\u00a0from differences in host use. We also find that recent admixture is both asymmetric and geographically variable. Linear regression analyses reveal that admixture proportion is predicted by indirect human disturbance (i.e., climate change) and not direct human disturbance (e.g., urbanisation) in both N. lecontei and N. pinetum. Lastly, in N. pinetum, we find evidence of a spurious association between admixture and direct human disturbance that disappears when regression models account for population structure via inclusion of genetic principal component scores as covariates. Together, our data suggest that indirect human disturbance and population structure both contribute to geographic variation in admixture between N. lecontei and N. pinetum. Our study also highlights the importance of adequately controlling for population structure when attempting to identify environmental predictors (human disturbance\u2010related or not) of hybridization."

    "content": "Abstract\nConsumers play a critical role in mediating plant and ecosystem responses to abiotic stress, yet their influence on belowground processes under changing environmental conditions remains underexplored. Insect consumers are vital components of grassland ecosystems that can shape ecosystem function and stability by mitigating how plant and microbial communities respond to abiotic stress, like drought. This study investigates how small\u2010bodied consumers influence the magnitude and stability of grassland belowground functions across gradients of abiotic stress. We conducted a fully factorial field experiment manipulating consumer presence and induced drought over a growing season. Our results reveal that the presence of consumers stabilizes bacterial biomass and microbial activity across variable soil moisture conditions. Interestingly, this consumer\u2010induced increase in ecosystem stability was driven by a destabilization of microbial communities, as indicated by increased variability in bacterial community composition and abundance. Consumer presence also shifted soil bacterial community composition and richness, while fungal communities were less affected. Combined, our results highlight another important dimension of ecosystem stability: community responsiveness and rapid adaptability. Additionally, our findings underscore the critical role of consumers in maintaining belowground ecosystem stability and highlight the need to consider trophic interactions when predicting the impacts of global change on grassland ecosystems."

We identify communities that disproportionately insure (functional sources) or depend on (functional sinks) neighbour communities. Applied to plants and birds, this approach reveals biogeographic patterns of functional vulnerability and resilience, informing conservation strategies under environmental change.\n\nABSTRACT\nBiodiversity can buffer ecosystem functioning against disturbances by allowing species to compensate for the functions lost through the extirpation of other species, a key process known as ecological insurance. Functional ecology has extended this idea by emphasising trait redundancy amongst species that help buffer core ecosystem functions. However, some functions might be supported only by species with distinct combinations of trait values, which are less likely to be redundant within local communities. Here, we present a new and widely applicable framework to quantify the spatial insurance of locally functionally distinct species amongst communities. Our framework characterises how communities can disproportionately insure (functional sources) or depend on (functional sinks) neighbour communities, a dual relationship that is not captured by traditional metrics of functional beta diversity. We illustrate the application of our framework at broad spatial scales for plants and birds, highlighting biogeographic patterns of functional sources and sinks. This trait\u2010based spatial perspective reveals functional vulnerability, as illustrated by bird communities where functional sources were disproportionately impacted by human activities. It also provides a new approach to identify regions that differ in potential resilience to environmental change and to inform conservation strategies grounded in spatial trait distributions, supporting the preservation of functional distinctiveness beyond a focus on local biodiversity metrics."

Ackerman</p>\n\nWith a goal of unveiling mechanisms by which vaccines can provide protection against HIV-1 acquisition, several studies have explored correlates of risk of HIV-1 acquisition in HVTN 505, which was a phase IIb trial conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a DNA plasmid and recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-vectored HIV vaccine regimen among individuals in the United States who were vulnerable to acquiring HIV. While this trial failed to meet its predetermined efficacy criteria, both immunological and virological correlates of reduced risk of acquisition have been reported, suggesting that at least some vaccine recipients were protected from some viruses. In this work, we describe application of a novel Positive-Unlabeled machine learning-based approach to infer protection status among vaccine recipients that did not acquire HIV, resulting in improved power to detect potential correlates of immunity. Having established the analytical robustness of protection status predictions using cross-validation and permutation testing strategies, we report increased confidence in previously identified correlates of risk, such as vaccine-elicited anti\u2013HIV-1 Env glycoprotein IgG3 antibodies and antibody-dependent phagocytosis, and the new observation of an inverse correlation between inferred vaccine-mediated protection and virus-specific IgA responses. Though its biological validity is not established, this inference approach offers a new means to use case-control datasets to identify candidate markers of effective immune responses in the context of low vaccine efficacy."

    "content": "<p>by Juan Arellano-Tint\u00f3, Daria Stepanova, Helen M. Byrne, Philip K. Maini, Tom\u00e1s Alarc\u00f3n</p>\n\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic network structure that surrounds, supports, and influences cell behaviour. It facilitates cell communication and plays an important role in cell functions such as growth and migration. One way that cells interact with the ECM is via focal adhesions, which enable them to sense and respond to matrix mechanical properties and exert traction forces that deform it. This mechanical interplay between cells and the ECM, many aspects of which remain incompletely understood, involves the coordination of processes acting at different spatial scales and is highly influenced by the mechanical properties of the cells, ECM and focal adhesion components. To gain a better understanding of these mechanical interactions, we have developed a multiscale agent-based model based on a mechanical description of forces that simultaneously integrates the mechanosensitive regulation of focal adhesions, cytoskeleton dynamics, and ECM deformation. We use our model to quantify cell-cell communication mediated by ECM deformation and to show how this process depends on the mechanical properties of cells, the ECM fibres and the topology of the ECM network. In particular, we analyse the influence of ECM stiffness and cell contraction activity in the transmission of mechanical cues between cells and how the distinct timescales associated with different processes influence cell-ECM interaction. Our model simulations predict increased ECM deformation for stronger cell contraction and a sweet spot of ECM stiffness for the transmission of mechanical cues along its fibres. We also show how the network topology affects the ability of stiffer ECMs to transmit deformation and how it can induce cell detachment from the ECM. Finally, we demonstrate that integrating processes across different spatial and temporal scales is crucial for understanding how mechanical communication influences cell behaviour."

Traxler, Trent R. Northen, Devin Coleman-Derr</p>\n\nThe genus <i>Streptomyces</i> has consistently been found enriched in drought-stressed plant root microbiomes, yet the ecological basis and functional variation underlying this enrichment at the strain and isolate level remain unclear. Using two 16S rRNA sequencing methods with different levels of taxonomic resolution, we confirmed drought-associated enrichment (DE) of <i>Streptomyces</i> in field-grown sorghum roots and identified five closely related but distinct amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to the genus with variable drought enrichment patterns. From a culture collection of sorghum root endophytes, we selected 12 <i>Streptomyces</i> isolates representing these ASVs for phenotypic and genomic characterization. Whole-genome sequencing revealed substantial variation in gene content, even among closely related isolates, and exometabolomic profiling showed distinct metabolic responses to media supplemented with drought- versus well-watered root tissue. Traits linked to drought survival, including osmotic stress tolerance, siderophore production, and carbon utilization, varied widely among isolates and were not phylogenetically conserved. Using a broader panel of 48 <i>Streptomyces</i>, we demonstrate that DE scores, determined through mono-association experiments in gnotobiotic sorghum systems, showed high variability and lacked correlation with plant growth promotion. Pangenome-wide association identified orthogroups involved in osmolyte transport (e.g., proP) and membrane biosynthesis (e.g., fabG) as positively associated with DE, though most associations lacked phylogenetic signal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that <i>Streptomyces</i> DE is not a conserved genus-level trait but is instead strain-specific and functionally heterogeneous. Furthermore, DE in the root microbiome was shown not to predict beneficial effects on plant growth. This work underscores the need to resolve functional traits at the strain level and highlights the complexity of microbe-host-environment interactions under abiotic stress."

    "content": "<p>by Celia Ferriol-Gonz\u00e1lez, Pilar Domingo-Calap</p>\n\nCapsule diversity is a major limiting factor for phage host range in capsulated bacterial hosts. Phage receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) recognize the capsule and initiate infection, making them key players in phage tropism. In this study, we applied an experimental evolution approach to investigate host range adaptation in a diverse 12-phage community interacting with a <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. community containing 39 distinct capsular types. Our findings revealed that generalist phages possessed highly evolvable RBPs, accumulating non-synonymous mutations that modulated their host range. In contrast, specialist phages acquired fewer mutations but remained stable in the community, maintaining their narrow host range. Additionally, recombination between co-infecting closely related phages facilitated rapid host range adaptation through RBP swapping. However, most recombined genes encoded endonucleases or proteins of unknown function, suggesting their potential role in phage survival. This study advances our understanding of phage host range evolution and provides new insights for optimizing phage-based applications."

Anti-tau antibodies can reduce pathology in mouse models of neurodegeneration and are currently being tested in humans. Here, we performed a large-scale seroepidemiological search for anti-tau IgG autoantibodies (\u03b1\u03c4) on 40,497 human plasma samples. High-titer \u03b1\u03c4<sup>+</sup> individuals were surprisingly prevalent, with hospital patients being three times more likely to be \u03b1\u03c4<sup>+</sup> (EC<sub>50</sub>\u2009\u2265\u20092<sup>6</sup>; a nominal dilution of >1/64) than healthy blood donors (4.8% versus 1.6%). The prevalence increased with age over 70 years-old (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.43, <i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and was higher for women (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.39, <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.002). The autoantibodies bound selectively to tau, inhibited tau aggregation in vitro, and interfered with tau detection in plasma samples. No association was found between \u03b1\u03c4 autoantibodies and neurological disorders. Instead, tau autoreactivity showed a significant association with kidney and urinary disorders (adjusted RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.45, <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.001 and 1.40, 95% CI 1.20\u20131.63, <i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively).

    "content": "<p>by Giulio Gabrieli, Richard Somervail, Andr\u00e9 Mouraux, Massimo Leandri, Patrick Haggard, Gian Domenico Iannetti</p>\n\nThe spinal cord is the key bridge between the brain and the body. However, scientific understanding of healthy spinal cord function has historically been limited because noninvasive measures of its neural activity have proven exceptionally challenging. In this work, we describe an enhanced recording and analysis approach, Electrical Spinal Imaging (ESI), to obtain noninvasive, high-resolution images of the spinal cord electrical activity in humans. ESI is analytically simple, easy to implement, and data-driven: it does not involve template-based strategies prone to produce spurious signals. Using this approach, we provide a detailed description and physiological characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the peripheral, spinal, and cortical activity elicited by somatosensory stimulation. We also demonstrate that attention modulates postsynaptic activity at spinal cord level. Our method has enabled five important insights regarding spinal cord activity. (1) We identified three distinct responses in the time domain: sP9, sN13, and sP22. (2) The sP9 is a traveling wave reflecting the afferent volley entering the spinal cord through the dorsal root. (3) In contrast, the sN13 and sP22 reflect segmental postsynaptic activity. (4) While the sP9 response is first seen on the dorsal electrodes ipsilateral to the stimulated side, the sN13 and sP22 were not lateralized with respect to the side of stimulation. (5) Unimodal attention strongly modulates the amplitude of the sP22, but not that of the sP9 and sN13 components. The proposed method offers critical insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of somatosensory processing within the spinal cord, paving the way for precise noninvasive functional monitoring of the spinal cord in basic and clinical neurophysiology."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/100653",
    "content": "Prosapip1 is a brain-specific protein, encoded by <i>Lzts3</i>, localized to the postsynaptic density, where it promotes dendritic spine maturation in primary hippocampal neurons. However, nothing is known about the role of Prosapip1 in vivo. To examine this, we utilized the Cre-loxP system to develop a Prosapip1 neuronal knockout mouse. We found that Prosapip1 controls the synaptic localization of its binding partner SPAR, along with PSD-95 and the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in the dorsal hippocampus (dHP). We next sought to identify the potential contribution of Prosapip1 to the activity and function of the NMDAR and found that Prosapip1 plays an important role in NMDAR-mediated transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the dHP. As LTP is the cellular hallmark of learning and memory, we examined the consequences of neuronal knockout of Prosapip1 on dHP-dependent memory. We found that global or dHP-specific neuronal knockout of Prosapip1 caused a deficit in learning and memor,y whereas developmental, locomotor, and anxiety phenotypes were normal. Taken together, Prosapip1 in the dHP promotes the proper localization of synaptic proteins which, in turn, facilitates LTP driving recognition, social, and spatial learning and memory."

    "content": "Abstract\nUnder global warming, extreme rainfall events have increased, causing annual economic losses of billions. Previous studies often treated high temperature and heavy rainfall as opposing phenomena, rarely considering their joint effects. However, emerging evidence suggests a direct link between antecedent heat conditions and subsequent precipitation extremes. As part of a typical extreme rainfall process, the high temperatures on July 26\u201327, 2023, drove the intensity and distribution of subsequent rainfall in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region from July 29 to August 1. Numerical simulations and sensitivity experiments reveal that the July 26\u201327 heat event significantly intensified moisture transport and convective activity over the Taihang Mountains. Specifically, net moisture influx increased by 19.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024%, while convective intensity rose by 15%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013%. These heat\u2010induced enhancements collectively resulted in a 22.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% increase in total rainfall. This mechanism provides a new explanation for future extreme rainfall events."

In this study, a well\u2010calibrated, dual\u2010polarization phased array radar (PAR) is used to examine three tornadic mesovortices in the 27 February 2023 QLCS in central Oklahoma, with rapid volumetric scanning strategies that included dense elevation angles. Through examining dual\u2010polarization profiles and three\u2010dimensional wind estimates around the mesovortices, we show that the mesovortices examined were associated with (a) downdrafts prior to tornadogenesis, (b) increased convergence along the QLCS gust front ahead of the downdrafts, and (c) dual\u2010polarization profiles that suggest evaporation and precipitation drove the downdrafts. This study represents the first time a dual\u2010polarization PAR has been used to document tornadic QLCS mesovortices."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study provides a kinematic explanation for why facies interfaces dominate solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers. Using flow and transport simulations, we apply kinematic metrics to quantify deformation processes that control plume evolution. Results show that strong conductivity contrasts generate preferential flow corridors, while transitional zones at facies interfaces act as persistent mixing fronts where stretching and folding intensify mixing. These cross\u2010facies transitions emerge as the primary controls on transport observables such as dispersion and dilution, with within\u2010facies variability exerting secondary effects. By linking sedimentary architecture to flow deformation, this work provides the mechanistic justification for earlier findings that cross\u2010transition probabilities govern solute spreading. The results highlight the need to resolve geologic interfaces in both field characterization and remediation design. Flow topology offers a unifying framework for predicting transport in aquifers and points to opportunities for geophysical methods to target the key architectural features that regulate mixing and dilution."

    "content": "Abstract\nCompound dry\u2013hot conditions increasingly threaten South and Southeast Asia, highlighting the need to understand drivers. Observations and numerical simulations reveal a robust polar\u2013low\u2010latitude teleconnection: the March Arctic stratospheric polar vortex (ASPV) strongly modulates March\u2013April compound dry\u2013hot conditions across the region. When the March ASPV weakens, anomalous easterlies in the lower Arctic stratosphere induce corresponding tropospheric easterlies and persist through April, cooling Siberia and accelerating the mid\u2010latitude westerlies. The resulting anticyclonic shear drives an anomalous anticyclone over northern South and Southeast Asia. Combined with the region's climatologically dry\u2013hot season, these processes promote compound dry\u2013hot conditions further amplified by positive soil moisture\u2013atmosphere feedback. Moreover, the March ASPV outweighs the preceding winter tropical sea surface temperature in shaping compound dry\u2013hot variability in this northern sector. Our results highlight the critical role of the Arctic stratospheric anomalies in driving low\u2010latitude climate, helping improve risk mitigation."

    "content": "Abstract\nSouthern Ocean phytoplankton have unique traits that allow them to survive extreme environmental conditions of low iron, light, and temperature. These traits are not well represented in Earth System Models and may lead to misrepresentation of the bloom seasonal cycle in this critical oceanic region. This has implications for understanding the role of the biological carbon pump in driving ocean carbon uptake and storage. We conduct a sensitivity analysis using a 1D model in the Subantarctic Zone to identify (a) the most sensitive parameters for improving representation of the seasonal cycle and its mechanisms and (b) the impact of these changes on carbon export. Lowering the phytoplankton iron quota or increasing zooplankton iron stoichiometry and both improve the seasonal cycle timing and amplitude, aligning chlorophyll and carbon seasonal cycle. However, the resulting increases in bloom amplitude translates into minimal change in carbon export due to enhanced cycling through the dissolved organic carbon pool."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Xianshuihe fault zone (XSHF) in southwestern China accommodates both aseismic creep and seismic slip, yet geological evidence constraining these processes remains limited. Hence, we conducted microstructural, geochemical, and rock magnetic analyses of fault\u2010zone materials from the Cuoniulongba River outcrop. Fault breccias and relatively undeformed sandstones adjacent to the principal slip zone (PSZ) exhibit elevated magnetic susceptibility (MS), likely reflecting monoclinic pyrrhotite precipitated from post\u2010seismic low\u2010temperature hydrothermal fluids. Creep\u2010related fault gouge within the PSZ is characterized by low MS. Notably, the gouge sample S4 within the PSZ shows high MS, reflecting magnetite neoformation induced by coseismic frictional heating (>500\u00b0C), consistent with the observation of thermal decomposed kaolinite due to fluid drainage. This study presents the geological evidence associated with the XSHF linked to aseismic creep, coseismic frictional heating, and post\u2010seismic hydrothermal alteration, and provides new insights into the seismic behavior of continental strike\u2010slip faults."

    "content": "Abstract\nPrevious studies emphasized a significant linkage between Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation multidecadal variability (AMOC\u2010MV) and subsurface temperature in the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA). However, as AMOC\u2010MV weakens under global warming, it remains unclear whether this linkage persists. Here, we use the Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble to demonstrate that the connection remains robust under global warming. We highlight that the TNA subsurface response and its changes are primarily confined to the western boundary, regulated by variations in the AMOC\u2010MV\u2010related North Brazil Current. In the TNA western boundary, a subsurface temperature dome, which dominates the subsurface thermal response by strengthening meridional heat transport, shifts southward due to changes in mean\u2010state AMOC and local winds. This southward shift extends the subsurface temperature response equatorward, amplifying the mean TNA response. The sustained linkage supports using TNA subsurface temperature as an indicator for future AMOC\u2010MV monitoring."

Using high resolution climate model simulations and reanalysis fields, we show that MHW intensity in the CS peaks in the subsurface, where vertical gradients of temperature are stronger, and that MHWs are associated with the passage of Rossby waves. Projections under the RCP8.5 scenario reveal that while the ocean continues to warm to the end of the century, subsurface MHW intensity weakens. This decline is associated with a weaker thermocline, reduced ocean currents and eddy kinetic energy, and less energetic Rossby waves. Reducing uncertainties in climate projections will be essential to improve our understanding of how marine heat extremes may evolve and affect Caribbean ecosystems."

After the mainshock, DAS continued observation including tremors more stably than DONET; therefore, DAS can be an effective means in monitoring seismicity when a large earthquake occurs. We located these tremors on the western edge of the slow earthquake area by envelope correlation and amplitude attenuation property with distance. These tremors activated several hours after the passage of surface waves of the earthquake. The number of tremors was larger than background tremor activity rate; therefore, this tremor activity can be related to the Noto Peninsula earthquake. A transient loading by the Noto Peninsula earthquake may have advanced the tremor occurrence, or pore pressure redistribution by a stress change may have caused the tremors."

The decay of streamer current is attributed to two\u2010 and three\u2010body attachment of electrons to molecular oxygen. The model predicts streamers of growing strength and spatial scales at altitudes where electron losses due to three\u2010body attachment are suppressed with reducing air pressure.

A novel index of convective rainfall deviation is defined in this study to quantify the spatial discrepancy between surface rainfall and cold\u2010cloud shields, utilizing the FY\u20104A brightness temperature data and surface rainfall observation data from across China. The results show that systems with larger deviations are more prevalent in southern China. For small\u2010deviation systems, surface rainfall closely coincides with the coldest center of the cloud shields. However, in medium\u2010deviation systems, rainfall occurs southwest of the coldest center, with relatively expanded but weakened rainfall beneath the cloud shields. Retaining a pronounced southwestern deviation signature, large\u2010deviation systems also present a secondary northeastern rainfall center. This complex spatial pattern is associated with increased cloud tilting driven by the configuration of environmental updrafts and low\u2010level southwesterly wind shears."
