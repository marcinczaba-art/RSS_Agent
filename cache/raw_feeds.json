    "content": "Abstract\nThe ocean plays a major role in controlling atmospheric carbon at decadal to millennial timescales, with benthic carbon representing the only geologic\u2010scale storage of oceanic carbon. Despite its importance, detailed benthic ocean observations are limited and representation of the benthic carbon cycle in ocean and Earth system models (ESMs) is mostly empirical with little prognostic capacity, which hinders our ability to properly understand the long\u2010term evolution of the carbon cycle and climate change\u2010related feedbacks. The Benthic Ecosystem and Carbon Synthesis (BECS) working group, with the support of the US Ocean Carbon & Biogeochemistry Program (OCB), identified key challenges limiting our understanding of benthic systems, opportunities to act on these challenges, and pathways to increase the representation of these systems in global modeling and observational efforts. We propose a set of priorities to advance mechanistic understanding and better quantify the importance of the benthos: (a) implementing a model intercomparison exercise with existing benthic models to support future model development, (b) data synthesis to inform both model parameterizations and future observations, (c) increased deployment of platforms and technologies in support of in situ benthic monitoring (e.g., from benchtop to field mesocosm), and (d) global coordination of a benthic observing program (\u201cGEOSed\u201d) to fill large regional data gaps and evaluate the mechanistic understanding of benthic processes acquired throughout the previous steps. Addressing these priorities will help inform solutions to both global and regional resource management and climate adaptation strategies."

(B) CCA act as sources of bacterial taxa that can establish and persist in adult E. singularis holobionts, independently of climate change effects.\n\nABSTRACT\nCrustose coralline algae (CCA) and their bacterial communities can emit chemical cues favoring coral larval settlement. Indeed, larvae of Eunicella singularis (white gorgonian) preferentially settle on CCA. Here, we investigated the effect of two Mediterranean CCA holobionts, Macroblastum dendrospermum and Lithophyllum stictiforme, on E. singularis larvae settlement and their bacterial communities, after warming and acidification treatments. We exposed CCA to temperature and pH expected for 2100 (SSP5\u20108.5) and to a marine heatwave event. Larval settlement increased 1.8\u20132.7 times in the presence of CCA exposed to warming and acidification compared to non\u2010exposed CCA. High abundance of bacteria belonging to the Pirellulaceae family was observed in all CCA, while a higher abundance of monosaccharides was found in exudates of exposed CCA. Based on CCA\u2010related 16S rDNA metabarcoding and metabolomics results, we hypothesize that the enhanced larval settlement was driven by the Pirellulaceae breakdown and utilization of CCA polysaccharides, in combination with polysaccharide release through the CCA cell walls likely augmented by decalcification. Furthermore, CCA acted as sources of bacterial taxa that may establish and persist in the adult E. singularis holobiont, independently of climate change effects. We conclude that CCA are key for E. singularis recruitment success, especially under future climate conditions, and contribute to their microbiome development."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Tibetan Plateau, known as the Third Pole, is experiencing rapid warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which profoundly influences the growth of crops such as highland barley. However, it remains unclear how highland barley photosynthesis quantitatively responds to changes in CO2 concentration and how the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship responds to warming on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we examined the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship of highland barley leaves at the heading stage and its developmental response to experimental warming (+1 and +2\u00b0C). The photosynthetic CO2 saturation concentration (Ca,sat) of highland barley leaves was 1,208.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0533.4\u00a0ppm, exceeding the current atmospheric CO2 concentration (419.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0ppm in 2022, Waliguan). Experimental warming did not significantly affect the maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax, 39.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 s\u22121), Ca,sat (1,208.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0533.4\u00a0ppm), the CO2 compensation concentration (Ca,com, 58.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.8\u00a0ppm), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax, 142.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121), and the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax, 193.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.0\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121) at a measurement temperature of 25\u00b0C. At +2\u00b0C warming, the carotenoid content of highland barley leaves increased by 5%\u201321%, whereas chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents were not significantly affected. Our findings highlight that the CO2 fertilization effect on highland barley leaf photosynthesis is expected to continue and experimental warming may developmentally influence highland barley leaf photosynthesis by altering the leaf carotenoid content rather than the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship."

Although Arctic warming and sea ice retreat have been well\u2010documented, the influence of tropical Atlantic SST on Arctic sea ice remains understudied. Using reanalysis data sets and model simulations, we demonstrate that tropical Atlantic warming significantly reduces Beaufort Sea SIC. This warming triggers a Rossby wave train that propagates northeastward, altering the high\u2010latitude atmospheric circulation and inducing southerly flow anomalies. These anomalies enhance moisture transport, increase cloud cover, and amplify downward longwave radiation accelerating sea ice melt. Our findings, supported by Community Atmosphere Model version 5 and Community Earth System Model simulations, highlight the crucial role of tropical\u2010Arctic teleconnections in Arctic sea ice variability."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nUnderstanding how dispersal impacts the genetic makeup of populations is essential for predicting their responses to environmental change. Gene flow\u2014via within\u2010population dispersal and external immigration\u2014shapes population health and evolutionary potential by boosting genetic diversity, but it can also counteract local adaptation. We investigate these processes in a population of great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, United Kingdom. This system represents a large, continuous population of a vagile, widely distributed species. Using a comprehensive social pedigree alongside two genomic datasets, one with 949 individuals genotyped at 600,000 SNPs and another with 2644 individuals typed at 10,000 SNPs, we demonstrate spatial genetic structure largely driven by the spatial and temporal clustering of close kin. We quantify how temporally persistent this pattern is and find that relatedness declines with geographic distance in a consistent manner across years, without a consistent genetic basis, a pattern which is frequently renewed due to high population turnover. Immigrants make up a substantial portion of the breeding population, yet are often assumed to be genetically distinct, unrelated and outbred\u2014assumptions that can bias population inferences. We show that immigrants are indeed outbred, as are local birds; have fewer close relatives within the population, and are less likely to be related to their neighbours than locally born birds. Despite low FST and no clear genome\u2010wide population structure, immigrants and locals can be distinguished above chance using a Random Forest classifier trained on SNP data. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dispersal, population turnover and spatial population structure, and suggests that great tits in Wytham Woods experience substantial gene flow within the population and from immigrants, maintaining high genetic diversity and reducing the possibility of local adaptation at this spatial scale."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nSalinity\u2014an essential factor shaping marine species distributions\u2014is rapidly shifting due to global change, yet the mechanisms of salinity tolerance and adaptation remain poorly understood. We investigated local adaptation in the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa, a broadly distributed marine species that thrives in the brackish Baltic Sea. Using a common\u2010garden design, we compared physiological and transcriptomic responses to low salinity between populations from the North Sea (>\u200925 PSU) and the Baltic Sea (<\u200915 PSU). Baltic copepods exhibited significantly higher survival under low salinity, indicating local adaptation. While both populations shared a core osmoregulatory strategy involving active ion transport and regulation of amino acids, transcriptomic profiles revealed population\u2010specific differences. Baltic individuals showed a reduced overall gene expression response, yet maintained higher relative expression of osmoregulatory genes\u2014suggesting a more efficient and primed transcriptomic response. In contrast, North Sea copepods exhibited broader transcriptional shifts, including downregulation of metabolic and developmental pathways after prolonged stress exposure, possibly reflecting energy conservation mechanisms. These findings reveal that A. tonsa possesses both a plastic osmoregulatory strategy and population\u2010level adaptation that enable survival in extreme salinity conditions. While both populations tolerate short\u2010term exposure to low salinity, local adaptation has enhanced the Baltic population's resilience. This suggests that A. tonsa is broadly tolerant of moderate climate\u2010driven salinity declines across most of its distribution. However, our data also indicate potential range contractions in the lowest salinity zones of the Baltic Sea, underscoring the importance of identifying physiological and genetic thresholds in climate resilience studies."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe heavy reliance on pyrethroid\u2010based interventions has largely driven insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, accelerating the spread of resistant strains, including resistant Anopheles funestus strains. The efficacy of insecticide\u2010based interventions, especially insecticide\u2010treated nets (ITNs), the cornerstone of malaria control and management, is threatened by the widespread occurrence of resistance, jeopardising malaria control efforts. Alpha\u2010cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid, is increasingly utilised in various ITN formulations, including those combined with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and chlorfenapyr\u2010based Interceptor G2 (IG2) nets, to enhance effectiveness against resistant mosquito populations. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of resistance is essential to monitor and track resistance trends for an effective malaria control program. In this study, we identified a 1.4\u2009Mb QTL on the telomeric end of the left arm of chromosome 2, conferring resistance to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin (rap1 QTL). Different crossing schemes and sequencing approaches were explored to determine the most effective strategy. Individual\u2010based QTL mapping performed on segregating individuals from an isofemale family identified a QTL at the F7 generation. Higher recombination density relative to the physical genome in the F7 isofemale family, with a recombination every 240\u2009kb, facilitated the detection of a QTL compared to the F2 family (335\u2009kb/cM). Additionally, we exploited bulk segregant analysis (BSA) between susceptible and resistant phenotypes from the F7 isofemale family and an F7 mixed cross\u2010family to perform cost\u2010effective and rapid QTL\u2010mapping discovery. The strongest signal in both independent BSA analyses overlaps with the rap1 QTL, further supporting its role in \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin resistance. The known resistant alleles of the cytochrome P450 CYP6P9a and 6.5\u2010kb structural variant within the rap1 QTL strongly correlate with survival to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin. In this study, we validated that previously developed DNA\u2010based assays, originally designed to monitor permethrin resistance, are effective for tracking resistance to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin as well. Additionally, we identified candidate variants that can serve as reliable markers for monitoring \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin resistance."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nAquatic insects are the most biodiverse freshwater animals. DNA metabarcoding data are increasingly used to assess variation in insect communities, but they are rarely integrated with information on the abundance or biomass of different taxa that can provide key insights into their functional responses. Here, we combined organismal metabarcoding and biomass estimates of different clades of aquatic insects to assess how different facets of their biodiversity (taxonomic and functional diversity; species traits) are affected by multiple stressors, including invasive species, drought and variation in vegetation. In 44 waterbodies in Northern Italy, we measured environmental features (e.g., pond surface, hydroperiod, and the presence of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and collected insect specimens. Specimens were weighed and then used for DNA metabarcoding. The relationship between biomass of seven insect orders and their relative abundance in metabarcoding data was used to obtain quantitative estimates of taxa biomasses across communities and to extract multiple diversity measures. Different facets of biodiversity showed distinct responses to the environmental stressors. The taxonomic diversity of insect communities strongly responded to aquatic vegetation, while functional diversity was more sensitive to the invasive crayfish. Total insect biomass was negatively related to fish presence, but insects with different functional traits showed specific responses to environmental features. Our results show that integrating metabarcoding data with biomass estimates can improve our understanding of community responses to multiple stressors and highlight the importance of considering multiple measures of diversity to get a comprehensive assessment of aquatic insects' responses to environmental variation."

However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In this study, we employed a data-driven approach to analyze recurrent functional connectivity patterns in resting-state fMRI data and developed a parameterized feedback inhibition model to characterize excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. The findings demonstrate that LSD enhances global brain synchrony and dynamic complexity. This enhanced synchrony likely stems from LSD\u2019s preferential stabilization of a globally synchronized yet functionally non-modular brain state - a pattern showing higher occurrence probability and acts as an \u201cattractor\u201d that recruits transitions from cognitive control networks. Crucially, these phenomena appear underpinned by LSD-induced convergence of excitatory/inhibitory balance across cortical hierarchies, particularly through Sensorimotor (SOM) suppression coupled with transmodal potentiation, where the Sensorimotor cortices emerge as potential regulatory hubs driving this neurochemical rebalancing. These convergent effects are consistent with the emergence of a brain state characterized by weakened sensory anchoring and enhanced cognitive flexibility, where the typical separation between concrete perception and abstract cognition becomes blurred. This neurophysiological remodeling therefore suggests a potential mechanism that could contribute to LSD\u2019s hallucinatory effects and its therapeutic potential in mental disorders characterized by rigid thought patterns."

Recent deep learning models have started to combine different types of cellular information, such as spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, ligand\u2013receptor signaling, and in some cases, gene regulatory networks. However, they often treat a cell\u2019s external interactions and internal gene regulation separately, merging them at the final step using simple concatenation or addition. This limits the model\u2019s ability to capture how cell\u2013cell communication and internal molecular states are connected. In this paper, we present MAGNET (Multi-view Graph Autoencoder with Cell-Gene Attention Network), a framework that reconstructs cell\u2013cell interaction networks by building multiple biological graphs and developing a Cell-Gene attention module to link a cell\u2019s environment with its internal gene activity in a unified representation. On benchmark datasets (seqFISH, MERFISH, STARMAP), MAGNET demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing cell-cell interaction networks, achieving an Average Precision(AP) of 0.901 on the seqFISH dataset and outperforming TENET by 0.185. The Cell-Gene Attention module is critical to MAGNET\u2019s performance, as its removal alone caused the AP on the seqFISH dataset to drop from 0.901 to 0.521. Applied to a breast cancer dataset, MAGNET found functional heterogeneity among cancer cells, distinguishing clusters with molecular signatures for either immune evasion or autonomous tumor growth."

In addition, we introduce a layout algorithm that aims to improve clarity by minimizing the total reticulate displacement of reticulate edges.

Kirk</p>\n\nThe subcellular localisation of proteins is a key determinant of their function. High-throughput analyses of these localisations can be performed using mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, which enables us to examine the localisation and relocalisation of proteins. Furthermore, complementary data sources can provide additional sources of functional or localisation information. Examples include protein annotations and other high-throughput \u2018omic assays. Integrating these modalities can provide new insights as well as additional confidence in results, but existing approaches for integrative analyses of spatial proteomics datasets, such as concatenation-based methods and transfer learning approaches like KNN-TL, are limited in the types of data they can integrate and do not quantify uncertainty in their predictions. Here we propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach (wherein model parameters are inferred from <i>both</i> labeled marker proteins and unlabeled data while quantifying prediction uncertainty) to integrate spatial proteomics datasets with other data sources, to improve the inference of protein sub-cellular localisation. We demonstrate our approach outperforms other transfer-learning methods and has greater flexibility in the data it can model - including categorical annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology terms), continuous measurements (e.g., protein abundance), and temporal profiles (e.g., time-series expression data). To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we apply our method to integrate spatial proteomics data generated for the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> with time-series gene expression data generated over its cell cycle. Our findings suggest that proteins linked to invasion organelles are associated with expression programs that peak at the end of the first cell-cycle. Furthermore, this integrative analysis divides the dense granule proteins into heterogeneous populations suggestive of potentially different functions. Our method is disseminated via the mdir R package available on the lead author\u2019s Github."

Einevoll</p>\n\nElectrical stimulation of nervous tissue is grounded in well-established biophysical principles, yet understanding its precise effect on neural activity remains challenging. This represents a major obstacle to both scientific and clinical applications of electrical brain stimulation.\nWe here show that the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism can be applied more broadly than previously acknowledged, providing a framework for elucidating the effects of electrical brain stimulation on neurons. Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation\u2013induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/<i>r</i> falloff for nearby and 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> falloff for distant neurons.\nWe also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.\nThe reciprocity-based approach to electrical stimulation reproduces a large body of previous experimental data, and provides new insights into how ES affects neurons."

    "content": "<p>by Nilapratim Sengupta, Jennifer I. Luebke, Christina M. Weaver</p>\n\nAction potentials (APs) propagate along axons to enable precise and rapid neuronal communication. Axon collaterals extend a given neuron\u2019s range by distributing signals to multiple targets, but also increase its electrical demands. Myelination facilitates saltatory conduction, dramatically enhancing transmission speed and ensuring conduction fidelity over long distances. The interplay between myelin dystrophy and axonal arborization remains largely unexplored, despite their role in the impairment of AP conduction in brain circuits. Here we used cohorts of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental models of rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) layer 3 pyramidal neurons to investigate how axon collateralization, myelin dystrophy, and other structural and biophysical perturbations affect AP conduction velocity (CV). We identified core diameter and branch point location, particularly its distance from the soma, as key structural determinants of CV. Under pathological conditions, branch points emerged as sites of heightened vulnerability, where even focal myelin damage markedly impaired conduction. The efficacy of remyelination to restore CV depended on the number of segments that replaced each demyelinated region. Effective length constant and focal input resistance largely predicted CV reductions caused by structural changes. In addition to demyelination, CV was highly sensitive to variations in axoplasmic and membrane resistivities, the formation of myelin balloons, and ion channel redistribution. These findings offer a mechanistic framework for understanding AP conduction in myelinated axons with complex topologies, while also pointing to potential factors underlying individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive impairments. This work thus provides an important building block for multiscale modeling of network and behavioral effects of aging, as well as axonopathies such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and traumatic brain injury."

    "content": "<p>by Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>\n\nShape perception is central to human vision, but its developmental origins remain unknown. Here we show that shape perception develops from three ingredients: (1) generic fitting systems, (2) embodied visual experiences, and (3) biologically plausible sensors. We first show that generic fitting models (transformers) trained on embodied visual experiences change from color-based to shape-based visual systems. We then perform <i>in silico</i> controlled-rearing experiments to determine what causes this developmental change. We find that view diversity\u2014experiencing many views of the same object\u2014produces shape perception. For embodied agents, view diversity comes for free: by moving through the world, agents acquire diverse temporally linked views, explaining how and why animals develop shape perception so rapidly. But when view diversity is restricted, by limiting where an agent can look or move, shape perception fails to develop. Finally, we show that retinas naturally transform images in ways that enhance shape learning, providing a biologically plausible substitute for artificial image augmentations. Together, our results support generic fitting theories of brain development and provide a template for building human-like shape perception in machines."

LCMSpector is a standalone graphical user interface application for straightforward analysis of targeted mass spectrometry data, distributed under the MIT license and available free of charge for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine by specifying the desired mass-to-charge ratios of the targeted compound ions and simply clicking \u201cProcess\u201d. It allows for the processing of multiple files simultaneously, freely modifying and exporting graphs in real time, and calculating compound concentrations based on calibration standards.

    "content": "<p>by Sol\u00e8ne Song, Paul Villoutreix</p>\n\nDevelopment is a complex process driven by coordinated cell proliferation, differentiation, and spatial organization. Classically, two ways to specify cell types during development have been hypothesized: the mosaic and regulative modes. In the mosaic mode, a particular cell isolated from the rest of the embryo will still give rise to progeny with the same fate as expected in normal development, relying on lineage-inherited factors. In contrast, in the regulative mode, the fate of a cell depends on its interactions with its environment and thus relies on space-dependent factors. While both modes often co-exist, their relative contributions remain poorly quantified at single-cell resolution. We present a novel approach to measure these contributions from single-cell data from <i>C. elegans</i> development. The invariant lineage of <i>C. elegans</i> allows the integration of spatial positions, lineage relationships, and protein expression data. Using single-cell protein expression profiles as a readout of cell state, we define two quantifiable metrics: 1) a proxy for the contribution of the mosaic mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell lineage distance and the cell-cell expression distance, 2) a proxy for the contribution of the regulative mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell context distance \u2013 capturing spatial neighborhood similarity - and the cell-cell expression distance. To validate these metrics, we compared empirical results from <i>C. elegans</i> to artificial models with defined developmental rules. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of mosaic and regulative modes, with their relative contributions varying across tissues and developmental stages. For example, in skin tissue, the mosaic mode dominates in early development, while the regulative mode prevails later. Our approach offers a quantitative, unbiased, and perturbation-free method to study fundamental principles of developmental biology."

    "content": "<p>by Sofia Radrizzani, Juan Rivas-Santisteban, Namshik Han, Laurence D. Hurst</p>\n\nDespite early assumptions of neutrality, numerous mechanisms are now thought to cause selection on synonymous mutations, commonly supported by a low evolutionary rate at synonymous sites (<i>K</i><sub>s</sub>). This has been best evidenced in the first ~10 codons of genes in <i>E. coli,</i> where <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is less than around half that of the gene body. Diverse lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these first ~10 codons are under selection for high AT content which causes low mRNA stability that in turn enables ribosomal initiation. There remains one enigmatic discrepancy, however, namely that the low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain extends far beyond the first 10 codons. Here we ask why this is. As we see no evidence that the zone influencing protein levels has been misestimated, we consider three further hypotheses: that reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is a) owing to overlapping genes, b) reflects an extended slow translational \u201cramp,\u201d and c) is mutational. We reject the first two as in both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus sp.</i> the extended low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain persists on analysis of non-overlapping genes and in <i>Bacillus</i>, where fast optimal codons tend to be A/T-ending, a fast-to-slow codon trend is seen. We fail to falsify the third hypothesis. Employing mutation accumulation data for <i>E. coli</i> we show that the 5\u2032 end has a lower mutation rate, with the first 10 codons having a rate around half that of the gene body, this then steadily increasing following the trend seen for <i>K</i><sub>s</sub>. Compositional variation is likely to explain some of the difference, the 5\u2032 end lacking GC-rich runs while these are most mutagenic. We conclude that even a highly reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is not always adequate to substantiate selection on synonymous mutations. This result has broad implications for inference of the causes of evolutionary rate variation."

    "content": "<p>by Ya-Wen Hsueh, Po-Min Chiang</p>\n\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) requires high sensitivity, throughput, and broad compatibility across specimens. Current high-capacity methods lack sensitivity compared to low-capacity counterparts. Moreover, tissue-specific methods for collecting cells/nuclei limit unbiased comparisons across samples. Here, we propose a Unified framework by Split-Pool barcoding with optimal-efficiency PolydeoxyAdenylation for scRNA detection (USPPAR). Using short and long dsDNA substrates, low Co\u00b2\u207a\u2009concentration, while eliminating all other metal-ion components, enabled terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to efficiently polydeoxyadenylate intractable blunt and 3\u2032 recessed dsDNA ends, which was unattainable with other systems. By benchmarking against six state-of-the-art technologies using HEK293, the efficient addition of PCR handles for cDNA amplification made USPPAR\u2019s gene detection sensitivity comparable to high-sensitivity methods and significantly higher than existing high-cell-capacity platforms. In primary PBMCs, USPPAR enabled high-sensitivity, high-resolution scRNA-seq, and lysine conjugation improved sensitivity as an RNase inactivator. Based on nuclease reporter and mRNA protection assays, partially chelated Cu\u00b2\u207a\u2009served as a potent, non-precipitating, broad-spectrum nuclease inhibitor across various pH levels. Beyond demonstrating high sensitivity in liver tissue, an organ with low nuclease activity, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with this inhibitor enabled one-pot extraction of RNA-stable nuclei from nuclease-rich tissues, such as the pancreas. Finally, comparisons with reference datasets from the 10\u00d7 platform using mouse spleen and maize tissues showed that USPPAR matched cell-type coverage while achieving higher gene-detection efficiency. With five key enzymes available and quality-controlled, USPPAR provides a unified, cost-effective, sensitive method for high-cell-capacity scRNA profiling of diverse specimens without special equipment."

    "content": "Memory reactivation renders consolidated memory fragile and thereby opens the window for memory updates, such as memory reconsolidation. However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory retrieval-extinction protocol prevents the return of fear expression shortly after extinction training, and this short-term effect is memory reactivation dependent (Study 1, <i>N</i>=57 adults). Furthermore, across different timescales, the memory retrieval-extinction paradigm triggers distinct types of fear amnesia in terms of cue specificity and cognitive control ability dependence, suggesting that the short-term fear amnesia might be caused by different mechanisms from the cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, <i>N</i>=79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, <i>N</i>=75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that both memory reactivation and intact prefrontal cortex function were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia after the retrieval-extinction protocol. The differences in temporal scale, cue specificity, and cognitive control ability dependence between the short- and long-term amnesia suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings suggest the potential involvement of coordinated memory modulation processes upon memory retrieval and may inform clinical approaches for treating persistent maladaptive memories."

    "content": "Forming new memories after a one-time experience requires initial encoding then consolidation over time. During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labeling 24 hr following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows us to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN\u2212 neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM\u2212 neurons. This suggests that CA3 PNs recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 PNs undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task."

Yet the quantitative rules linking single-cell decision-making to tissue-scale organization remain poorly resolved. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that defines an order parameter predicting when initially disordered colonies undergo a transition to ordered fate alignment and when minimal, localized inputs can redirect their collective state. This analysis reveals a distinct control regime in which multicellular assemblies become susceptible to a single engineered guide cell. We validate these predictions by introducing guide cells that integrate into unperturbed colonies and redirect fate patterns within the theoretically defined control windows. Together, these results connect single-cell decision rules to emergent tissue-level organization and establish a generalizable biological control strategy in which a minority engineered subset can reliably redirect the developmental trajectory of a much larger multicellular population."

The results revealed a high concordance between metagenomic and Sanger sequencing for species identification (Kappa = 0.667, P = 0.011). Metagenomic analysis identified vector-specific dominant bacteria, including Wolbachia in mosquitoes, Blattabacterium sp. in cockroaches, Bartonella tribocorum and Leptospira interrogans in rodents, and Vagococcus teuberi in flies. It also detected numerous classical pathogens, such as Enterococcus faecalis, L. interrogans, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Among the identified fungi and viruses, 19 were human pathogens, while seven posed a threat to agriculture, notably Pepper mild mottle virus and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus. These findings systematically characterize the microbial communities associated with various vectors, highlight the potential of metagenomics for broad pathogen screening, and underscore its utility in large-scale vector surveillance and public health protection."

    "content": "Abstract\nDissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is the dominant form of bioavailable nitrogen in the euphotic zone of subtropical gyres, where nitrate (NO3\u2212) concentrations are low. However, identifying regions where DON consumption may support surface ocean productivity remains challenging due to the relatively narrow range in euphotic zone DON concentrations. The stable isotopic composition (\u03b415N) of DON has recently emerged as a sensitive tool for identifying regions of DON production and consumption in the surface ocean. Here, we report DON concentration and \u03b415N measurements in the upper \u223c300\u00a0m from a >10, 000\u00a0km zonal GO\u2010SHIP transect along \u223c30\u00b0S in the South Pacific (P06\u20102017 transect) from the Chilean to the Australian coasts. We observed higher upper 50\u00a0m DON concentrations in the east associated with DON production in regions with elevated primary productivity. Upper 50\u00a0m DON \u03b415N decreases from east to the west, coincident with a gradient in the \u03b415N of subsurface (i.e., 100\u2013200\u00a0m) NO3\u2212, consistent with subsurface NO3\u2212 fueling DON production. Further, both the partial and complete assimilation of surface NO3\u2212 observed along the transect are imprinted on the \u03b415N of surface DON. An inverse relationship between the concentration and \u03b415N of surface DON was found in the western portion of the transect, consistent with DON consumption by phytoplankton. Combining concentrations and \u03b415N of DON, we identified regions of DON production and consumption across the largest subtropical ocean gyre."

    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the oceanic Copper (Cu) budget is essential for tracing nutrient pathways, interpreting ancient sediment records, and assessing global environmental changes. However, the global oceanic Cu cycle remains imbalanced, largely due to insufficient studies on the flux and isotopic composition of authigenic Cu in oxic pelagic sediments. Here, we present the Cu isotopic compositions of pelagic sediments collected from the western (non\u2010hydrothermal area) and eastern South (hydrothermal area) Pacific Ocean. These results indicate that authigenic Cu in pelagic sediments is primarily hosted by iron\u2010manganese (oxyhydr)oxides. The isotopic composition of authigenic Cu in pelagic sediments (0.01\u2030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u2030, 2SD) is considerably lighter than the previously assumed value of \u223c0.3\u2030, which was based on the Cu isotopic compositions of iron\u2010manganese crusts and nodules. Using these new isotopic constraints, together with a newly calculated Cu flux to pelagic sediments of 15.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0mol\u00a0yr\u22121, we propose a new, balanced oceanic budget for Cu isotopes. This study precisely defines the flux and isotopic composition of the largest oceanic Cu sink, placing new constraints on the marine Cu cycle."

While 30% of carriage isolates could not be assigned a genogroup, all invasive isolates were successfully genogrouped. Genogroup B (MenB) predominated, representing 27% of carriage and 75% of IMD isolates.

    "content": "Abstract\nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, with river discharge as a major transport mechanism from land to ocean. As the second\u2010largest freshwater contributor to oceans, Asia experiences significant hydroclimatic variations, yet, observations are patchy across watersheds and climate zones. Here, we compiled 1,593 DOC observations from 40 studies spanning most Asian climate zones to map large\u2010scale patterns, and tested hydroclimatic controls for a set of representative watersheds (Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong, Ganges\u2010Brahmaputra, and Rajang) where sufficient time series records exist. Our findings show DOC concentrations peaking near the equator (tropical rainforest) and again above \u223c40\u00b0N (humid continental dry winter), with tributaries exhibiting higher and more variable levels than mainstems. Hydroclimatic responses were basin\u2010dependent: DOC\u2010precipitation correlation was not significant, yet DOC significantly differed across precipitation groups with highest means at low precipitation, indicating nonlinearity and likely thresholds; temperature effects diverged by basin; and soil moisture was a consistent positive driver, especially in Mekong and Yangtze. Overall, this study highlights that DOC behavior in Asia cannot be captured by uniform assumptions across basins and climate zones. As most existing observations are limited to short\u2010term data sets, the impacts of hydroclimatic change on carbon transport remain uncertain and require long\u2010term data sets. Future research should take an interdisciplinary approach by integrating hydrology, geomorphology, and climate indicators by fusing remote sensing based observations and advanced analytics, to address differences in DOC behavior and climate challenges."

    "content": "Abstract\nUtilizing 250\u2010m resolution sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) data from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite in combination with mooring measurements, this research investigates the three\u2010dimensional evolution of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in the northern South China Sea (nSCS). A novel inversion method based on the horizontal momentum equation was developed to retrieve ISW amplitudes from SSHA data, yielding a mean absolute deviation of 16% relative to mooring measurements. Application of this method to ISW SSHA (5\u201360\u00a0cm) in the nSCS revealed ISW amplitude distributions spanning 10\u2013250\u00a0m. A stratification\u2010modulated quasi\u2010linear correlation between amplitude and SSHA was identified in waters deeper than 1,000\u00a0m, with slope coefficients ranging from \u223c350 (July\u2013September) to \u223c530 (January\u2013March), enabling fast amplitude estimation from SWOT observations. SWOT's orbital configurations allow tracking of ISW evolution in the nSCS at daily intervals, revealing three key features of ISW evolution: (a) the total energy integrated along the ISW crest typically decreased, and the south\u2010strong\u2013north\u2010weak asymmetry of the ISW crest generally reversed during the basin\u2010to\u2010slope propagation; (b) in addition to distorting the wave crest, mesoscale eddies are linked to ISW amplitude increases of up to 34% in energy convergence portions and decreases of up to 49% in energy divergence portions; (c) oblique interactions between ISWs generated near the Batan and Babuyan Islands notably enhanced the ISW amplitude. This research underscores the potential of combining SWOT and mooring data to better monitor ISW structure and understand their interactions with mesoscale features."

    "content": "<p>by Chenhui Ma, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>\n\nUnderstanding how chemotherapy perturbs cell cycle dynamics is critical for advancing cancer treatment. We develop a probabilistic, multi-generational framework based on a Bellman\u2013Harris branching process to quantify treatment-induced shifts in tumor cell dynamics. The model incorporates key drug-responsive behaviors, including checkpoint activation, apoptosis, and checkpoint adaptation that propagates inherited DNA damage, enabling the characterization of heterogeneous survival outcomes after treatment. Biological parameters map directly onto DNA repair fidelity and cell-fate decisions, providing mechanistic insights beyond what is accessible from experiments alone. Dose-dependent extensions further allow exploration of treatment-induced perturbations. Model parameters were calibrated to empirical cell cycle measurements using the robust adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Global sensitivity analysis shows that scale parameters governing unfaithful DNA repair under G2/M- and S phase\u2013specific agents exert major influence on model predictions, particularly at later time points. Across three chemotherapies, the framework reveals consistent dose-dependent alterations in cell cycle dynamics, with higher doses driving pronounced disruptions. Together, these results demonstrate how model-informed analyses can provide quantitative insight into treatment-induced cell cycle perturbations and support the refinement of therapeutic strategies."

    "content": "<p>by Naoyuki Okamoto, Michael Taylor, Takatomi Kubo, Shin Ishii, Benedetto De Martino, Aurelio Cortese</p>\n\nMistakes are valuable learning opportunities, yet in uncertain environments, whether a lack of reward is due to poor performance or bad luck can be hard to tell. To investigate how humans address this issue, we developed a visuomotor task where rewards depended on either skill or chance. Participants consistently displayed a self-attribution bias, crediting successes to their own ability while blaming failures on randomness, an effect that influenced their subsequent decisions. Computational modelling revealed two underlying mechanisms\u2014a distorted perception of ability and a positivity bias in the skill condition. Notably, while distorted self-perception shaped behaviour, it did not affect confidence; instead, self-attribution bias led to overconfidence in external blame. These findings suggest a more complex picture in which self-attribution biases arise from both perceptual distortions and post-decision evaluations, highlighting the need for an interplay between experimental design and computational modelling to understand behavioural biases."

Recent work has suggested that one cause of this age difference in exploration is a reduction in the extent to which older adults use \u201crandom exploration\u201d \u2013 exploration driven by behavioral variability. Here we investigate potential mechanisms for this age-related difference in random exploration through the lens of a drift diffusion model (DDM) of the explore-exploit choice. In this model, random exploration can be modulated by two mechanisms \u2013 the fidelity with which information about the choice is represented in the brain, the \u201csignal-to-noise ratio\u201d (SNR), and the amount of information required to make a decision, the \u201cdecision threshold.\u201d Reduced random exploration in aging could be caused either by an increase in signal-to-noise ratio or an increase in decision threshold in older adults. By fitting the DDM to choices and response times in a sample of healthy younger and older adults, we found that older adults had a lower SNR and a higher threshold than younger adults. This suggests that reduced random exploration in aging is driven by higher response thresholds in older adults, which may compensate for the reduced signal-to-noise ratio with which decision information is represented in the brain."

However, from invertebrates to mammals, age-related decline is typically restricted to specific neuron types or brain parts, indicating differential vulnerability. The rules to pinpoint the susceptibility of distinct brain elements to aging remain largely unknown. Here, we combine longitudinal studies with neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and optophysiological analyses in the <i>Drosophila</i> genetic model to identify aging-susceptible and aging-resilient elements in a sensorimotor circuit that underlies escape. Young and mid-aged flies escape predator-like visual stimuli with a jump followed by flight, but behavioral performance declines with age. Mapping the underlying functional decline into the brain shows that most circuit components are robust against aging and remain functional even in old flies that have lost the behavior. By contrast, behavioral decline is caused by the selective decay of synaptic transmission between one specific visual projection neuron type (LC4) and the dendrite of one identified descending neuron (GF). Structurally, presynaptic active zone marker density is reduced whereas postsynaptic marker density remains normal. Other central synapses in this circuit as well as neuromuscular synapses are robust to aging. The synaptic connection susceptible to aging is also the circuit element most vulnerable to starvation or oxidative stress. Moreover, the vulnerable circuit element is also required for habituation, and thus, underlying circuit plasticity. In conjunction with data from mammalian brains our data suggest that a trade-off for functional neural circuit plasticity might be vulnerability to aging."

    "content": "<p>by Yanying Yu, Nicole E. Wheeler, Lars Barquist</p>\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to human health. Increasingly, genome sequencing is being applied for the surveillance of bacterial pathogens, producing a wealth of data to train machine learning (ML) applications to predict AMR and identify resistance determinants. However, bacterial populations are highly structured, and sampling is biased towards human disease isolates, violating ML assumptions of independence between samples. This is rarely considered in applications of ML to AMR. Here, we demonstrate the confounding effects of sample structure by analyzing over 24,000 whole genome sequences and AMR phenotypes from five diverse pathogens, using pathological training data where resistance is confounded with phylogeny. We show the resulting ML models perform poorly and that increasing the training sample size fails to rescue performance. A comprehensive analysis of 6,740 models identifies species- and drug-specific effects on model accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of current ML approaches in the face of realistic sampling biases and underscore the need for population structure-aware methods and more diverse datasets to improve AMR prediction and surveillance."

    "content": "<p>by Salsabil Arabi, Chaoqun Ni, B. Ian Hutchins</p>\n\nDuring career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals reject large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands, but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists\u2019 articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) they are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which, under journal-level evaluation regimes, may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work; however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10%\u201320% of this influential work."

    "content": "Neuronal function is intimately tied to axodendritic polarity. Neurotransmitter release, for example, is usually the role of the axon. There are widespread exceptions to this rule, however, including many mammalian neuronal types that can release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. In the mouse olfactory bulb, closely related subclasses of dopaminergic interneuron differ markedly in their polarity, with one subtype lacking an axon entirely. These axon-bearing and anaxonic dopaminergic subclasses have distinct developmental profiles and sensory responses, but how their fundamental polarity differences translate to functional outputs remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide anatomical evidence for distinct neurotransmitter release strategies among these closely related dopaminergic subtypes: anaxonic cells release from their dendrites, while axon-bearing neurons release exclusively from their intermittently myelinated axon. These structural differences are linked to a clear functional distinction: anaxonic, but not axon-bearing, dopaminergic neurons are capable of self-inhibition. Our findings suggest that variations in polarity can produce striking distinctions in neuronal outputs, and that even closely related neuronal subclasses may play entirely separate roles in sensory information processing."

    "content": "Background: The development of new drugs against afflictions that disproportionately impact poorly resourced areas around the globe is an expensive endeavor. As cost-effective alternatives, strategic combinations of approved drugs can be used to enhance the efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum. Understanding the metabolic consequences of such combinations is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and delaying drug resistance. Methods: An integrated metabolomic and pharmacological analysis was performed on P. falciparum exposed to chloroquine (CQ), pyrimethamine (PY), sulfadoxine (SD), and their combinations (SDPY and SDCQ). Dose-response assays were used to quantify drug potency, whereas untargeted metabolomic profiling was used to assess pathway-level perturbations associated with individual and combined treatments. Results: Dose-response assays confirmed the nanomolar potency of PY (IC50; = 12.5 nM) and CQ (IC50; = 11 nM) compared with the micromolar efficacy of SD (IC50; = 9.1 microM), which is consistent with its role as a synergistic antifolate partner. Metabolomic profiling revealed that PY strongly disrupted folate-dependent pyrimidine biosynthesis, leading to deoxyuridine and dUMP accumulation, whereas SD caused milder perturbations, which was consistent with DHPS inhibition. CQ produced modest metabolic effects alone but markedly amplified antifolate-induced stress when combined with PY. Drug combinations generated metabolic responses that are distinct from those resulting from individual treatments. Across antifolate combinations, consistent trends included reduced amino acid pools, suppression of thiamine and glutathione metabolism, and enhanced PPP inhibition, leading to broad disruption of nucleotide, redox, and carbon metabolism. Conclusions: Pyrimidine suppression has emerged as the central hallmark of antifolate-based therapy in P. falciparum. The distinct synergistic signatures observed with drug combinations support their potential to enhance efficacy and delay resistance. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for guiding antimalarial combination policies, optimizing therapeutic regimens, and strengthening rational drug-design strategies."

While its upstream regulation is well studied, the mechanisms by which MAPK activation leads to diverse transcriptional outcomes remain incompletely understood. To address this shortcoming, we mapped the target gene sets controlled by 22 RAF-inducible transcription factors using targeted Perturb-seq and integrated these data with time-resolved transcriptional profiling. Network reconstruction revealed a topology dominated by two central hubs, EGR1 and FOS, which co-regulate partially overlapping target gene sets. In addition, we uncovered a positive feedback loop between EGR1, a canonical RAF-MAPK effector, and TCF7, a transcription factor typically linked to Wnt signaling. Through this interaction, TCF7 emerges as a nexus that integrates MAPK and Wnt pathway inputs. Together, these findings define the architecture of RAF-MAPK-driven transcriptional regulation and demonstrate how cross-talk between oncogenic signaling pathways can be encoded in transcriptional networks."

We characterised fungal communities of two pine-feeding Ips bark beetles, I. sexdentatus and I. acuminatus, in larval, pupal, and adult stages, and in wild versus laboratory populations, using high-throughput ITS2 amplicon sequencing combined with qPCR and functional assays. Both beetles harboured a stable core mycobiome dominated by Kuraishia, Ogataea, Ophiostoma, Graphilbum and Cyberlindnera, while adults showed species-specific differences and wild beetles, especially I. acuminatus, exhibited greater diversity than laboratory populations. Beetles shared more taxa with unfed control wood than with gallery wood, indicating acquisition during feeding and concurrent restructuring of the wood mycobiome. Monoterpene bioassays on beetle-associated yeasts revealed that mixtures of -pinene, 3-carene and terpinolene suppressed growth more strongly than single compounds, suggesting synergistic inhibition. Yeasts selectively antagonised entomopathogenic fungi and expressed complementary cell-wall-lytic and digestive activities, consistent with combined roles in pathogen suppression and plant-polymer deconstruction. Our results show that Ips mycobiomes are conserved yet dynamic across life stages and environments, and emphasise the importance of multi-terpene and interaction assays for understanding bark beetle-fungus-conifer interactions."

    "content": "Cholera is a diarrheal disease that affects millions of people globally. Although the causative agent, Vibrio cholerae, has been extensively studied in isolation, investigation of its interactions with the gut microbiota started relatively recently. We and others previously showed that microbiota-derived metabolites significantly influence V. cholerae behavior. By investigating how an organic extract of human feces affects V. cholerae gene expression, we showed that gut metabolites strongly suppress swimming motility, a trait important for host colonization. Interestingly, extracts of pure cultures of a gut commensal, Enterocloster citroniae, recapitulated this inhibition. Here, we present a comprehensive examination of the effect of small molecules produced by E. citroniae and related species on V. cholerae behavior. We show that E. citroniae small molecules inhibit motility by various V. cholerae strains, and that several phylogenetically related species produce this activity, although the magnitude of the effect varies between strains. Using biofilm formation assays in static and flow conditions, we show that V. cholerae strongly induces biofilm formation in response to E. citroniae metabolites. Transcriptome and reporter analyses showed that several genes involved in synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide are induced by E. citroniae metabolites. Lastly, we show that V. cholerae interactions with host cells are also modulated by this commensal. These findings advance our understanding of microbiome-pathogen interactions and how commensal bacteria influence V. cholerae virulence through the production of small molecules. In the future, this knowledge may be used to design novel microbiome-based therapeutic approaches to combat cholera and other infections."

Both strains efficiently infected and replicated within tick cells, with ISE6 supporting more robust growth. Electron microscopy images revealed that Ot maintains its characteristic cytoplasmic, non-vacuolar location in tick cells and exits infected cells by budding off the surface in a membrane-encased structure. Time-course immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated progressive intracellular replication and dynamic expression of Ot outer membrane autotransporters ScaA and ScaC, with ScaC enriched early in infection and ScaA at later stages. Metabolic labelling using a clickable methionine analog L-homopropargylglycine showed that high ScaA abundance correlated with reduced translational activity, suggesting a link between ScaA abundance and late-stage or extracellular-like developmental states. The subcellular location of Ot in tick cells differs from the characteristic dynein-driven perinuclear clustering observed in mammalian cells, and was not sensitive to disruption of microtubules, indicating a distinct mode of distribution. Together, these findings identify tick cell lines as tractable and biologically relevant arthropod models for studying Ot and dissecting host-microbe interactions."

    "content": "The release of bacterial bioactive molecules across the gut barrier is a crucial yet poorly understood step in microbe-host communication. Here we unravel a phage-driven mechanism that enables this process in a nutritional symbiont. In Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NC8 (LpNC8), we identify a stress-inducible prophage, pp2, that undergoes genotoxic-stress-dependent activation and triggers holin-lysin-mediated lysis. This controlled lytic program produces phage particles together with extracellular, membrane-derived bacterial particles, and is strictly required for the ability of LpNC8 to promote juvenile growth in nutritionally challenged Drosophila melanogaster. Disruption of pp2-dependent lysis abolishes particle release in vitro and eliminates the growth-promoting effect in vivo, without altering bacterial abundance in the gut. The magnitude of phage release correlates with the extent of host growth promotion, indicating that prophage induction contributes to the export of symbiotic factors. These findings reveal prophage-induced lysis as a central and previously unrecognized mechanism by which a beneficial gut bacterium enhances host development under nutritional stress."

    "content": "Population-specific variation in animal microbiomes is well documented, yet the functional consequences and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this, we conducted genome-resolved metagenomic analyses on gut and skin microbiomes from four populations of Pyrenean brook salamanders (Calotriton asper) inhabiting two distinct environments (Pyrenean subalpine brooks and Atlantic montane streams). From paired faecal and skin swab samples, we reconstructed 539 and 43 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), respectively, and examined taxonomic composition, metabolic capacity, and microdiversity across environments. While alpha diversity remained consistent, both gut and skin microbiomes exhibited significant differences in community composition and functional potential between environments. Partitioning the gut microbiome into core, endemic, and marginal fractions revealed a dominant core community, shared across environments and accounting for over 85% of reads, that did not drive functional divergence. Instead, functional differences were primarily shaped by low-abundance, population-specific endemic bacteria. Atlantic salamanders hosted endemic taxa with significantly greater metabolic potential and higher strain-level microdiversity than those at the Pyrenees. These patterns were not explained by dietary differences and may reflect environmental influences such as temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings highlight the relevance of rare, endemic bacteria in driving microbiome function and underscore the power of genome-resolved metagenomics to uncover functional and evolutionary dynamics in wild host-microbe systems."

Their global diversity results from various local variables, including technological practices, as well as the metabolic activity of diverse microorganisms. In Europe, this typicity is exemplified by Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses, for which genetic diversity remains largely unexplored. Combining culturomics (n = 373 bacterial genomes) and metagenomic (n = 146 metagenomes), we performed a national-scale survey of the microbial diversity encompassing 44 French PDO cheeses. Taxonomic (bacteria, fungi and viruses) and functional profiling reveal a high diversity in the cheese rind, mainly driven by the cheese technology. We also reconstructed 1,119 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) encompassing seven phyla, including Actinomycetota, Bacillota, Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota. Using GTDB as a reference, we identified 221 MAGs encompassing 46 genera, as well as 44 bacterial isolate genomes encompassing eight genera, which represent potentially 81 new species (based on <95% ANI). These species were particularly numerous among the genera Halomonas, Psychrobacter and Brachybacterium. Similar results were observed when compared with the cFMD database. We combined our genomic and metagenomic datasets into a catalog of 26.2 million protein clusters, with 50% of these clusters remaining unassigned to a known function and taxonomy. We illustrated the potential of this resource by searching for methionine gamma-lyase (MGL), an enzyme playing a significant role in cheese flavor. This protein was predominantly found in Pseudoalteromonas, a potentially new MGL-producing genus, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Hafnia, and its prevalence varied with cheese technology. Our study provides a substantial genomic resource for food microbiologists and cheesemakers to further explore the biotechnological potential of PDO cheese biodiversity."

Ciliates are particularly abundant and diverse in anoxia, but their global diversity and distribution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of public 18S rDNA datasets, along with one dataset generated here, to assess the global diversity and ecology of marine anaerobic ciliates. Using a novel pipeline, we processed 2854 samples from 42 studies spanning 19 habitat types. We recovered 3196 anaerobic ciliate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) across all described lineages. Based on clade-specific divergence thresholds derived from phylogenetic distances, 28.4-46.3% of ASVs qualified as novel. Most sequences belonged to the poorly described plagiopylean family Epalxellidae, suggesting a large reservoir of undescribed diversity in this clade. Community comparisons revealed close phylogenetic similarities between some shallow-water and deep-sea assemblages, suggesting that shared redox conditions may shape communities more than water depth. Our results demonstrate that marine anaerobic ciliates are globally distributed, taxonomically diverse, and rich in novel lineages. This study provides a framework for leveraging environmental sequencing data to better understand the diversity and ecology of neglected protist lineages and under-sampled habitats."

While the dynamic changes in genome organization in cellular organisms have been well described, the 3D folding of phage genomes during the infection of their host is extremely limited. Understanding how phage genomes fold, invade and rearrange the genome of their host to functionally organize the optimal expression of their genes remains unknown. Here, we explore the spatial dynamics of the virulent double-stranded DNA phage PAK_P3 during infection of its host Pseudomonas aeruginosa and reveal how its genome rapidly decondenses to adopt a specific 3D organization that reflects its transcriptional program. Concomitantly, the host genome decondenses as gene expression wanes and transcription induced domains vanish. We also uncover specific and discrete bridging of the host and the phage genomes, showing how the phage genome exploits the spatial genome architecture of its host to succeed in its infection cycle. Our data highlights an unprecedented level of genome folding and gene expression regulation during a viral infection."

Co-selection is now recognised as a significant driver of antimicrobial resistance, with established links between heavy metal exposure and the presence of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance. The precise mechanisms that drive this process in the environment are co-resistance, cross-resistance, and co-regulation, but their respective impacts remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated whether heavy metal contamination in freshwater sediments selects for bacteria harbouring plasmids that carry both metal and antibiotic resistance genes, or genes encoding cross-resistance mechanisms. A diverse set of plasmids was recovered from metal-impacted sites at Lake Macquarie (New South Wales, Australia), which carried resistance genes particularly to copper, zinc, cobalt, cadmium, and arsenic. Two-thirds of these plasmids also carried one or more antibiotic resistance genes, indicating co-selection through the co-resistance mechanism. Functional assessment confirmed that the multi-metal and polymyxin resistance plasmid genotype was linked to the corresponding bacterial phenotype. The metagenome of the metal-impacted sediments was also examined to explore evidence of co-selection, and a broad range of incomplete plasmid sequences containing homologues of both metal- and antibiotic-resistance genes was detected. This study demonstrates the important link between anthropogenic heavy metal contamination and potentially clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes. It highlights the importance of approaching the management of antimicrobial resistance from a One Health perspective."

In Campylobacter jejuni, the stochastic nature of PV has hindered the systematic functional analysis of phase-variable genes (PVGs). Here, we introduce PV-GenShift, a genome-scale screening platform built on a genetically stabilized library of phase-locked C. jejuni variants. By fixing the ON/OFF states of 15 PVGs, PV-GenShift enables reproducible, high-resolution analysis of phasotypes, defined as unique ON/OFF combinations across multiple PVGs, under defined selective pressures. Using models of human serum exposure, murine colonization, and chicken gut passage, we identified distinct phasotypes associated with serum resistance and with enrichment during mouse colonization, particularly involving capsular polysaccharide modifications such as O-methyl phosphoramidation and methylation. In contrast, chicken gut passage resulted in heterogeneous ON/OFF shifts without a dominant phasotype. These findings highlight the combinatorial impact of PVG expression states on bacterial adaptation and establish PV-GenShift as a broadly applicable framework for dissecting PV-driven phenotypic diversity. This approach provides a scalable strategy for exploring genotype-phenotype relationships and offers insights relevant to vaccine design and targeted therapeutics."

Deep-learning predictions identified 5.47 million candidate antimicrobial peptides (c_AMPs), revealing a peptide space far larger and structurally distinct from known AMPs. Deep-sea c_AMPs are longer, enriched in nonpolar and acidic residues, and exhibit low charge and high intrinsic disorder, suggesting non-membranolytic modes of action. We synthesized 131 representative peptides, of which 87% were antimicrobial, with MICs as low as 1.25 M, broad-spectrum antibacterial and even antifungal efficacy, and minimal mammalian cytotoxicity. Transcriptomics, TEM imaging, and peptide-protein modeling showed that representative peptides preserve membrane integrity while disrupting intracellular processes such as translation and metabolism, supporting intracellular, non-lytic mechanisms. This work uncovers a vast reservoir of previously unrecognized deep-sea small proteins and structurally unconventional AMPs, providing a foundational resource for discovering next-generation peptide therapeutics."

This pigment results from alterations in tyrosine catabolism. Melanin synthesis from tryptophan has never been reported in Pseudomonas. In this study, we describe a tryptophan-derived melanin in P. aeruginosa PAH, a strain that was isolated from a fibrocystic patient. PAH produced a brown pigment when grown in LB or L-tryptophan-supplemented media. Structural analysis revealed this pigment was composed by two fractions differing in NaOH solubility: a soluble one consistent of pyomelanin, and an insoluble fraction with a complex structure containing substituted indolic units. A pyomelanin inhibitor enhanced total melanin synthesis, mainly the insoluble fraction, and a tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor decreased pigment formation. Metabolomic profiling identified distinct indolic compounds and low levels of anthranilate in PAH cultures. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the presence of mutations and downregulation of genes related to pyoverdine biosynthesis. Furthermore, iron supplementation in the culture medium reduced melanin production. Overall, tryptophan arises as a key compound for melanin production in PAH, expanding the diversity of melanins synthesized by this genus. Furthermore, iron deprivation emerges as a critical factor triggering melanin biosynthesis, probably as a survival strategy enabling persistence in the fibrocystic lung environment."

Despite the rising incidence and clinical concern of Mab infections, treatment options are limited and often ineffective. Treatment is complicated by Mabs ability to persist in a non-replicative, drug-resistant state. Several {beta}-lactam antibiotics are potently bactericidal against Mab but are underutilized because their molecular mechanisms of action against Mab are incompletely understood. In the current study, we used {beta}-lactam-derived activity-based probes and chemoproteomics to report the first comprehensive list of enzymes in Mab targeted by {beta}-lactams. We compared {beta}-lactam targets across two Mab subspecies in actively replicating and non-replicative cultures, using a new carbon starvation model of persistence. We identified 17 targets that were active in every condition tested, seven of which were previously unknown to bind {beta}-lactams. Lastly, we characterized the {beta}-lactamase activity and {beta}-lactam inhibition profiles of nine Mab enzymes, demonstrating that imipenem inhibits these targets more effectively than cefoxitin. These findings provide clarity on the mechanisms of action of clinically relevant {beta}-lactams in Mab, a crucial step toward fully realizing their potential for treating infections caused by this opportunistic pathogen."

These bacteria employ various virulence factors, including extracellular type IV pili (T4P), which serve as essential appendages for DNA uptake, biofilm formation, and resistance to antibiotics. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bacteriophages (phages) exploit these retractile pili as entry receptors, but the exact mechanism of viral RNA delivery following pilus binding and retraction remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the entry mechanism of the ssRNA phage AP205 by identifying the specific phage components necessary for T4P detachment, a key step in viral genome entry. Our data reveals the phage's maturation protein (Mat) is sufficient to induce pilus detachment on its own, and the overall virion structure further enhances the efficiency of this process. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how ssRNA phages exploit bacterial T4P as part of their infection pathway and suggest a conserved strategy for host entry."

    "content": "Background: The interactions between the host organism and the microbiota play an important role in the host's survival, influencing its physiology and adaptation. The Antarctic, due to its extreme living conditions, is a unique region for studying such interactions. However, research on the microbiomes of Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates remains limited, especially with regard to the region's sole endemic insect, Belgica antarctica. Our aim was to study the B. antarctica microbiome collected from different substrates and from varying ornithogenic influence levels. Methods: A total of 330 B. antarctica larvae and moss substrates were sampled at three sites with different ornithogenic impact, followed by DNA extraction using Qiagen kits. The V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, followed by bioinformatic processing in QIIME2 for OTU clustering, taxonomic classification, and diversity analysis. Further analysis and visualization was performed in R, Python and GraphPad Prism. Results: Amplicon sequencing revealed rich microbial diversity, with NMDS demonstrating clear clustering of samples according to their origin (insects vs substrate) and ornithogenic influence level. Comparative analysis revealed that the vast majority of OTUs associated with B. antarctica (ca. 95%) were shared with substrates, whereas the insect-specific fraction was small, highly variable, and partially influenced by moss species. Ornithogenic influence significantly structured the symbiotic microbiota in both insects and substrates, reducing microbial diversity and altering the relative abundance of major bacterial taxa. Overall, substrate type and ornithogenic impact are significant factors influencing microbial community structure, while insect-specific taxa formed only a minor, heterogeneous component of this midge microbiome. Additionally, the Wolbachia infection was detected in B. antarctica larvae for the first time. Conclusion: The substrate that B. antarctica inhabits, as well as ornithogenic influence, play a significant role in the shaping of the species' microbiome. This Antarctic chironomid also maintains a core microbial community. The detection of Wolbachia in B. antarctica is the first evidence of this endosymbiont in Antarctica."

In this study we analysed the capsule genetics of E. coli ST131 by interrogating 3,033 genomes. Our data show a clonal distribution of capsule types and identify a monophyletic group of ST131 clade C strains which are characterised by an atypical capsule operon with highly divergent alleles of the key kpsM and kpsT genes. Our analysis suggests there is ongoing evolution within clade C of ST131 which looks to be driven not by continuing evolution of antimicrobial resistance, but by host-pathogen interactions."

Yet, its influence on the invasion success of genetically resistant strains remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the influence of bacterial heteroresistance, growth, and antibiotic selection on the outcome of an invasion experiment. We quantified the invasion dynamics of a bioluminescent colistin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain across a colistin concentration gradient during co-culture with colistin-susceptible clinical P. aeruginosa isolates with varying levels of heteroresistance. The observed variation in heteroresistance and fitness of the clinical isolates allowed investigation of the impact of these factors on invasion dynamics. We hypothesized that fitter isolates would limit invasion through competitive exclusion, while heteroresistant isolates, despite their growth costs, may serve as reservoirs for resistance evolution under antibiotic selection. Our results show that in antibiotic-free conditions, faster-growing isolates competitively excluded the colistin resistant invader while isolates with high levels of heteroresistance failed to do so. This competitive landscape shifted with increasing colistin concentration, giving the invader a fitness advantage that peaked around 2-4xMIC of the clinical isolate. The shift in the landscape over the colistin gradient might further have been influenced by the presence of heteroresistance in the clinical isolates. These findings reveal how both heteroresistance and competitive exclusion shapes invasion dynamics. Understanding these interactions is critical for redesigning treatment strategies that minimize ecological opportunities for resistant strains to establish and expand."

In the wild type, regulator EcpR/MatA demonstrated the highest correlation with the biofilm intensity, and its role was, in particular, seemingly reinforced by stress/pH-homeostasis and c-di-GMP-linked factors. duxuR exhibited the strongest stochasticity in biofilm formation, while in duxuR-tr, replicate dispersion was mostly muted, indicating that uxuR-derived sRNAs buffer motility-adhesion switching. In dcrp, pgaA was de-repressed due to the absence of CsrA, with expression being highly consistent with intensity of biofilm formation, alongside stress/ion-homeostasis genes. This is in line with the suggestion that CRP regulates biofilms and motility indirectly via regulation of more local transcription factors. Overall, replicate-resolved clustering converts apparent \"noise\" into structured regulatory patterns, which include genes whose role in biofilm formation was not yet evident, and helps identify switch nodes between planktonic and biofilm bacterial states."

    "content": "Antibiotic resistance is often assumed to be constrained by fitness costs that limit the spread of highly resistant strains. Yet, many resistance mechanisms -- including enzymatic antibiotic degradation -- can arise with little or no metabolic cost, raising an important question: why is extreme resistance not more widespread? Here, we show that community-level interactions impose a hidden ecological cost on high resistance. By performing experiments with simple communities comprised of antibiotic resistant clinical isolates and an antibiotic susceptible strain, we find that when exposed to betalactam antibiotics, strains with a higher degree of antibiotic resistance can promote the survival of co-habiting susceptible strains. Guided by mean-field modeling, we find that highly resistant bacteria accelerate detoxification of the shared environment, shortening the period during which resistance confers a competitive advantage. Experiments with an engineered strain with tunable resistance level confirm that susceptible cells grow best in the presence of highly resistant strains. Importantly, this effect does not require evolved cooperation or active enzyme secretion; experimental and modeling results show that unavoidable processes, such as cell death or passive leakage, prevent complete privatization of resistance, giving rise to ``accidental cooperation\". These findings suggest that resistance evolution is not only shaped by intrinsic cellular costs but also by ecological feedback that limits the benefits of incremental increases in resistance. This result may be reflected in the phenotypic responses of the clinical strains tested in this work, which fell into distinct low- and high-resistance classes with no intermediate phenotypes. Thus, this work demonstrates the important role of community dynamics in understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance and treatment outcomes."

Here, we systematically explore the effect of five core bacteria, Snodgrassella alvi, Bifidobacterium asteroides, BombilactobacillusFirm-4, Lactobacillus Firm-5, and Gilliamella apicola, on the longevity of individual honey bees. Generating gnotobiotic bees harboring all 32 different combinations of the core bacteria, we found that bacterial colonization generally reduces the host lifespan. This indicates that despite commensal gut microbes coevolved with the host, their presence is in principle costly for survival of individual bees. Regression analysis including higher-order interactions reveals that bacterial interactions have significant impacts on the host lifespan and show a qualitative trend: 2- and 4-way interactions exhibit positive, while 3- and 5-way interactions are negative. Numerical simulations based on a general Lotka-Volterra model demonstrate that the observed trend is reproduced when competitive interactions dominate in the bacterial community. This study combining empirical and theoretical approaches suggests the general costs of harboring gut microbiota and the stabilization of the bacterial community by higher-order interactions, which will advance our understanding of how commensal gut microbes and their interactions specifically influence host physiology."

    "content": "Above-ground vertical structure is a critical variable for ecosystem monitoring, carbon accounting, and land management. However, the high cost and limited coverage of airborne lidar hinder its widespread application. To address this, we developed NAIP-CHM, a 0.6-meter resolution canopy height and structure model (CHM) covering the contiguous United States, derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery. Unlike forestry-specific models that exclude human-made features, NAIP-CHM characterizes the full vertical structure of the landscape including vegetation, buildings, and infrastructure. We utilized a U-Net convolutional neural network with attention mechanisms and environmental conditioning, training the model on 18 million lidar-derived training pairs with stratified sampling to ensure robustness in open-canopy ecosystems. Assessing performance against 2.3 million independent samples, the model achieved a root mean square error of 1.57 meters and coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.87. We release the dataset, source code, and cloud-based tools to enable broad application without requiring specialized computational resources."

    "content": "Body size in mammals spans 20 orders of magnitude and is strongly correlated with ecology, making it one of the most important characteristics for a mammal. Body mass must be estimated for fossil mammals because the whole organism is rarely fully preserved. Although the relationships between anatomical characters and body mass have been calculated for many groups of mammals, rodents are less well studied. Previous work had limited sampling of species or used a species average for body size and may not be accurate. Because rodents are the most species rich order of mammals having accurate relationships for the different families of rodents is crucial for understanding the evolution of body size in rodents. I analysed the relationship between body size and three skull characters (skull, molar (M1), and toothrow length) in 11 species of cricetid rodents from Nebraska using reduced major axis regressions. I found a significant positive relationship between all characters and body size. Skull and toothrow length are the best predictors of body size. M1 length is not as good of a predictor because one genus (Microtus) has an unusually large M1 length for its body size. Separate regression equations for the Arvicolines and the Sigmodontids provide better predictors for body size using lower M1 length. This work will allow for more accurate predictions of body mass in extinct cricetids."

    "content": "In wildlife research, wild-caught vertebrates are often given anti-parasitic drugs when brought into captivity to protect animal health and reduce confounding effects of parasitic infection on research outcomes. However, the impacts of antiparasitic drugs on non-target parasite taxa are understudied, especially regarding host sex. To help address this gap, we investigated the impact of an anthelmintic medication on a protozoan gut parasite by quantifying coccidia oocyst burden in the feces of wild-caught dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) before and after two oral doses of ivermectin. Prior to treatment, males showed higher oocyst burdens than females. Following treatment, ivermectin-treated males showed larger increases in oocyst burden compared to both control males and ivermectin-treated females, while there was no difference in baseline and post-treatment oocyst burden in treated females. Our results suggest that wild-caught songbirds should be housed separately by sex during ivermectin treatment and that male enclosures should be cleaned at a relatively higher frequency due to excessive oocyst shedding. It is unclear whether increases in oocyst burden among males were attributable to helminth removal or a direct impact of ivermectin on host immune function. Further work investigating sex differences in the impact of antiparasitic drugs on non-target parasite taxa is warranted."

    "content": "The ambrosia beetle Platypus cylindrus Fab. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Platypodinae) has been associated in Portugal with cork oak (Quercus suber) tree death since the 1980s. Although traditionally known as a secondary pest damaging stressed and dead trees, its aggressiveness changed over the last decades. Ambrosia beetle is an insect known for its interactions with several species of fungi aiming for the gain of biologic functions that facilitates its life cycle. How bacterial communities harbored by ambrosia beetle impact forest ecosystems is not yet well known. In oak species, some pathogenic bacteria are often associated with wood insect infestations. From P. cylindrus body and wood tree bored galleries, culture dependent methods led to the isolation of bacteria involved in wood degradation and beetle ecology and even a new bacterial cork oak pathogen. To complement colony isolation efforts for the identification of the beetle-cork oak associated bacterial community, the same samples were analyzed with 16S metabarcoding. Two distinct bacterial communities from beetle mycangia and wood galleries sharing the most abundant bacterial taxa were revealed. A group of genera from Enterobacterales and Bradyrhizobium prevailed in the samples from wood galleries. Comparison between ASVs and full 16S sequences allowed the identification of Pectobacteriaceae as the major taxon from unclassified Enterobacterales carried by the beetle. Prediction of metabolic pathways varying between wood galleries and beetle mycangia revealed upregulation in the galleries of carbohydrate and virulence factors. Together, these analyses efficiently compared the bacteriome from the wood galleries with the beetle mycangia, revealing different bacterial communities and specific ecological roles related to both the beetle and trees. Additionally, they gave insights into the comparability of culture-dependent and independent methods in bacteriome analysis."

    "content": "Conservation biocontrol is crucial for crop pest management, but the impact of agricultural management practices on natural enemies of crop pests is poorly characterised. The timing of crop sowing could impact arthropod communities by altering basal resource availability and quality, manifesting in altered nutrient availability and cascading impacts to natural enemy fitness and function. This study aims to understand these potential modifiers of conservation biocontrol, by investigating how the timing of crop sowing impacts arthropod predator nutrition and whether associated differences relate to changes in prey availability. Arthropod predators and their prey were collected from adjacent plots of winter- and spring-sown wheat. The biochemical macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid and protein) content of predators was determined by colorimetric assays and compared between winter- and spring-sown crops using multivariate models. Predator nutrient contents were compared to predator-prey interactions inferred using null network models based on both recent and current prey availability. The nutrient contents of arthropod predators differed significantly between winter- and spring-sown wheat, and the prey available to predators similarly differed, but neither recent nor current prey availability explained differences in predator nutrition. These findings may indicate that prey quality, rather than identity, changes with the developmental stages of crops sown at different times. This has important implications for the spillover of natural enemies of crop pests between crops sown at different times. This is especially true following harvest of winter-sown crops, which may disrupt biocontrol by altering the nutrients available to and sought by natural enemies of crop pests."

    "content": "Current epidemiological models for the regulation of host populations by pathogens suggest that the reduction in the host population is largest shortly after the epidemic phase and that the host population partly recovers in the subsequent approach to endemicity. We find that this conventional view is not robust to a simple, biologically motivated addition: density-dependent population regulation (homeostasis). While rapid homeostasis typically enables a population rebound after the initial population suppression (the conventional view), but weak homeostasis results in the opposite --- greater population suppression during the endemic phase compared to the initial epidemic. The effect of homeostasis can be substantial. This finding complicates the prediction of long term outcomes of population suppression by pathogens but not of short term outcomes."

A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current.

However, current fabrication methods often suffer from limited gradient precision, restricted material compatibility, and poor reproducibility. Here, we introduced gradient regulation via acoustofluidic dynamic engineering (GRADE), a programmable system to generate high-fidelity gradient biomaterials across different material systems. By incorporating focused interdigital transducers with the pulsed surface acoustic wave actuation, GRADE can achieve tunable and directional acoustic streaming (0 to 22\u00a0millimeters per second), which allows accurate regulation of the gradient magnitude and length. Its open microchannel design enables nondestructive extraction of centimeter-scale gradients and supports device reuse, enhancing practicality and scalability. In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform\u2019s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication.

Building on our prior glycine-proline\u2013based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit.

Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25\u00b0 to 95\u00b0C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release.

Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease sequencing (CUT&amp;RUN) revealed increased astrocytic CREB DNA binding in response to cocaine. Viral-mediated manipulation of nucleus accumbens astrocytic CREB activity in combination with addiction-related behaviors revealed that astrocytic CREB increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine. Furthermore, we identified potential molecular mechanisms of astrocytic CREB\u2019s influence through modulating astrocytic calcium dynamics and selectively increasing D1-type medium spiny neuronal activity.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression.

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities.

    "content": "Predicting how climate change will affect the population dynamics and ultimately persistence of plant and animal populations is a grand challenge in biodiversity science and global change biology. Competing approaches have emerged for how to explicitly connect climate drivers to demography. In our manuscript, we synthesise this rapidly moving field while highlighting strengths and limitations of competing approaches; provide a practical guide for using environment\u2010explicit demographic modelling to predict population dynamics; and offer guidance for how to overcome challenges associated with prediction and forecasting in this realm.\n\nABSTRACT\nPredicting the effects of climate change on plant and animal populations is an urgent challenge for understanding the fate of biodiversity under global change. At the surface, quantifying how climate drives the vital rates that underlie population dynamics appears simple, yet many decisions are required to connect climate to demographic data. Competing approaches have emerged in the literature with little consensus around best practices. Here we provide a practical guide for how to best link vital rates to climate for the purposes of inference and projection of population dynamics. We first describe the sources of demographic and climate data underlying population models. We then focus on best practices to model the relationships between vital rates and climate, highlighting what we can learn from mechanistic and phenomenological models. Finally, we discuss the challenges of prediction and forecasting in the face of uncertainty about climate\u2010demographic relationships as well as future climate. We conclude by suggesting ways forward to build this field of research into one that makes robust forecasts of population persistence, with opportunities for synthesis across species."

Sutton, Katia Koelle</p>\n\nIn an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aim to identify animal viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans. These studies have revealed substantial diversity in identified viruses. However, the number of tools currently available to assess pandemic risk is limited. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using <i>in vitro</i> laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outcomes that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we use within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals to estimate parameters relevant to transmission between pairs of individuals. We then extend this model to estimate epidemiological parameters, such as reproduction numbers and generation intervals. We present our analytical framework in the context of two influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (Cal/2009) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (Hong Kong/1968). In a head-to-head comparison, we find that Cal/2009 has higher pandemic potential than Hong Kong/1968. Our results depend on several assumptions, including that within-host viral dynamics in humans and those in the model animal used (here, ferrets) share quantitative similarities and that viral transmissibility between model animals reflects viral transmissibility between humans. The methods we present to assess pandemic risk of viral isolates can be used to improve relative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern."

    "content": "<p>by Christopher H. Bohrer, Daniel R. Larson</p>\n\nNumerous functions hinge on the spatial arrangement of different genomic loci. Hence, microscopy techniques, such as chromatin tracing, have been developed to localize multiple loci in fixed cells. Depending on the throughput and specifics of the experiment, localization errors can still obscure the true spatial locations. We have developed a post-processing methodology to address this challenge without the need for additional experimentation: Loci Enabled Advanced Resolution (LEAR). By leveraging the fact that localization errors increase the variability of the displacements between loci, and given an approximation of the localization error, we can approximate the ground truth spatial variation for each pair of loci to guide an iterative error correction process. After validating our approach with simulation and experiment, we then applied our approach to existing chromatin tracing data that probed the relation between chromatin organization and <i>Sox2</i> regulation, where previous work found no clear correlation between enhancer-promoter proximity and transcription bursts in individual cells. We discovered a correlation previously obscured by localization error, clearly demonstrating the need for the methodology. We then investigated the influence of loop-extrusion on higher order multi-way contact frequencies, which dramatically increased with the application of the LEAR method, finding that certain multi-way contacts were only present with loop-extrusion."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/106201",
    "content": "Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal network oscillations associated with memory consolidation. They are characterized by the co-occurrence of fast and slow field potentials across CA1 layers: the fast-frequency oscillations, known as ripples, are prominent in the pyramidal cell layer, where they coincide with increased neuronal spiking, while slower negative transients, referred to as sharp waves, occur simultaneously in the <i>stratum radiatum</i>. SWRs have traditionally been considered globally synchronous across the hippocampus; however, recent evidence suggests that ripples may be less synchronous than previously thought, particularly between the two hemispheres (Villalobos et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited this question using a unique dataset from probes spanning the septo-temporal axis of CA1 in rats. Our results demonstrate that ripples are phase-locked within but not between hemispheres, although their occurrence remains time-locked across both the septo-temporal axis and hemispheres. We also observed a similar synchronicity pattern for spiking activity: neurons are locally phase-coupled and globally time-coupled to ripple events. Interneurons exhibit a much stronger phase coupling to both ipsilateral and contralateral ripples than pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that ripples are locally phase-coupled through pyramidal\u2013interneuron interactions, with global time-locking likely driven by a common bilateral CA3 input and potentially modulated by interneuron circuits."

We find a significant reduction in TACL\u2013S in the northern mid\u2010latitudes, dominated by stronger winter land warming, alongside an increase in the northern high latitudes, dominated by stronger winter sea warming, during 1941\u20132014. In particular, these anthropogenic changes are projected to intensify in 2015\u20132100, with an additional emergence of TACL\u2013S increases dominated by summer land warming in the southern mid\u2010latitudes. Thus, a future tripolar pattern of TACL\u2013S heralds novel land\u2013sea climate regimes with far\u2010reaching climatic impacts."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Arctic has seen dramatic changes in recent decades. Here we use a simple metric, the Arctic residence time of air, that is, the time air spends uninterruptedly north of 70\u00b0 ${}^{\\circ}$N, to evaluate how these changes have affected the high\u2010latitude atmospheric circulation in the last 40\u00a0years. We find that, on average, near\u2010surface air resides between 7 (winter) and 12 (summer) days in the Arctic. This residence time has decreased almost year\u2010round since the 1980s, especially pronounced in the seasonal transition periods (fall: \u2212 ${-}$0.9\u00a0days; spring: \u2212 ${-}$1.4\u00a0days). The more pronounced reduction in spring also affects higher atmospheric layers. Our analysis indicates that this reduction is likely linked to the observed sea ice loss, decrease in snow cover, and increase in temperature. Furthermore, it indicates a speed\u2010up of the circulation, effectively making the Arctic less isolated and more prone to influences from mid\u2010latitudes."

At Sumisu Caldera, trapdoor faulting has recurred quasi\u2010regularly, roughly at \u223c10\u2010year intervals, generating earthquakes of moment magnitude 5.4\u20135.7 and producing tsunamis due to meter\u2010scale co\u2010seismic uplift. To assess event similarity and infer controlling factors, we compare seismic and tsunami waveforms at broadband period range (0.2\u2013500\u00a0s). The 1996, 2015, and 2024 events exhibit nearly identical waveforms, indicating rupture of a persistent major asperity with stable geometry and processes. Similar but non\u2010identical earthquakes suggest partial rupture or additional minor asperities. Comparable repeating sequences at other submarine calderas further support that trapdoor faulting is generally governed by major asperities, while variations in recurrence patterns may reflect differences in fault properties among calderas. These results demonstrate that trapdoor faulting recurrency is controlled by major asperities on ring faults, sustained by long\u2010term, stable magma supply."

While riverine sediment is well studied, marine\u2010sourced sediment remains understudied, particularly in regions with limited river input. We examined the influence of marine\u2010sourced sediment on salt marsh stability across 103 sites in the Northeastern US, using a new satellite\u2010derived suspended sediment concentration (SSC) product. Marsh vulnerability was assessed using the Unvegetated\u2010to\u2010Vegetated Ratio (UVVR) and relative marsh elevation (Z*). We identified two thresholds: SSC >20\u00a0mg/L and RSLR <5.2\u00a0mm/year. Marshes meeting either threshold tended to remain intact, while those with both low SSC and high RSLR were more vulnerable to degradation. A north\u2013south gradient was observed, with most unstable marshes in the southern region, where SSC declined by 0.9% per decade on average, compared to 0.072% in the north.

    "content": "Abstract\nMachine learning (ML) precipitation forecasting models typically employ a mean squared error\u00a0(MSE) loss function for optimization. However, due to the well\u2010known \u201cdouble penalty\u201d effect, MSE\u2010based losses often lead to overly smoothed prediction fields and a systematic underestimation of the frequency of\u00a0heavy rainfall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel probability\u2010matching (PM) based loss for ML precipitation nowcasting and short\u2010term forecasting, comparing its performance with other classical losses. Comprehensive skill evaluation demonstrates that PM\u2010based loss offers relatively more balanced and consistent performance across metrics, particularly its lower forecast bias from light to heavy rainfall intensities. Spectral power analysis further indicates that PM\u2010based loss better preserves small\u2010scale precipitation variability throughout the forecast period. Additionally, it results in a forecast frequency distribution of precipitation that more closely aligns with the observed distribution. These findings indicate consistent improvements in predictive skill and reliability of ML precipitation forecasts when trained with the PM\u2010based loss."

The model is applied to MJ\u22654.0 ${M}_{J}\\ge 4.0$ earthquakes that occurred between 2001 and 2010 around the Kakioka (KAK) station in Japan, with two types of anomalies, ultralow frequency (ULF) magnetic anomalies and carbon monoxide (CO) anomalies, as external excitations. Results indicate that 14.33% of the earthquakes can be interpreted by the external excitation of anomalies. Proposed ETAS\u00a0+\u00a0ULF\u00a0+\u00a0CO model achieves an overall probability gain of 1,013.55 in forecasting 218 earthquakes compared to the purely temporal ETAS model. Statistical significance is assessed by fitting the same model to the same earthquake catalog but with randomized anomaly occurrence times, confirming that the performance improvement is not due to overfitting.

We demonstrate that this boundary is marked by a distinct spectral change: a power\u2010law form in the plasma sheet transitions to an exponential form within the outer radiation belt. These findings are supported by comparisons with Polar\u2010orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) observations, and we discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for the spectral transition."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study investigates climate drivers influencing interannual changes in the rapid intensification (RI) ratio of western North Pacific tropical cyclones during July\u2013November from 1982 to 2024. We find a pronounced simultaneous correlation between basinwide RI ratio and the Aleutian Low index (ALI). In high ALI years when the Aleutian Low is weakened, the RI ratio is significantly reduced over the region spanning 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N, 135\u00b0E\u2013160\u00b0E, predominantly driven by enhanced 850\u2013200\u2010hPa vertical wind shear (VWS). Other commonly investigated RI\u2010related environmental variables show only small ALI\u2010driven modulations over the primary focus region of this study. In high ALI years, enhanced VWS is mainly induced by anomalous westerlies in the southeastern part of a broad anomalous cyclone centered in the subtropical central North Pacific. This anomalous cyclone can be further linked to strong wave activity fluxes originating from the AL region and propagating southward into the subtropical North Pacific."

    "content": "Abstract\nMass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet is largest in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, due to basal melting by warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW). In this study we find that subsurface temperature variability near the ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment from a global ocean\u2010sea ice model is able to track observed temperature variability and satellite\u2010derived basal melt rates. Simulated ocean temperature variability is controlled by a two\u2010stage response to the regional winds. A weakening of the prevailing southeasterly winds initially redistributes heat by lifting the thermocline, bringing warm mCDW up from depth near the ice shelf front. This is followed by a lagged widespread warming across the continental shelf due to water mass property changes, driven by horizontal advection and vertical mixing. Our results suggest a limited role of internal ocean variability and meltwater feedbacks on the observed variability on interannual timescales."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate models project a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) that will reduce Arctic warming. However, there is substantial intermodel spread in the projected AMOC decline, and its contribution to uncertainty in projected Arctic warming has not yet been quantified. To investigate this, we perform model experiments that increase CO2 concentrations while imposing the intermodel spread in the AMOC decline. We find that this intermodel spread in the AMOC decline reproduces 45% of the total intermodel spread in Arctic warming. A smaller AMOC decline increases Arctic warming via increased northward ocean heat transport, atmospheric moisture transport, and positive Arctic feedbacks. Arctic warming is more sensitive to AMOC differences that produce larger sea\u2010ice changes. Combined with a strong correlation between a small AMOC decline and Arctic warming across models, these results indicate that ocean circulation is a key source of model uncertainty in projections of Arctic warming."

    "content": "Abstract\nFault rocks vary in mineralogy but understanding the role of mineralogy in injection\u2010induced fault slip behavior remains challenging. We conduct laboratory fluid injection experiments on representative faults with distinct surface mineralogy, injecting fluid at a constant rate of 0.6\u00a0mL/min and under a confining pressure of 20\u00a0MPa, to examine how mineralogy affects fluid\u2010driven slip and seismicity. We find that the fault surface with a higher content of tectosilicates (quartz, microcline, albite, totaling 96%) exhibit higher shear strength. The tectosilicate\u2010rich fault takes a longer time to reactivate but accumulates seismic moment more rapidly, indicating more intense seismicity. In contrast, the fault containing\u00a0abundant phyllosilicates (50% biotite) promotes a transition from unsteady stick\u2010slip to steady slip during fluid injection. Stick\u2010slip events in the tectosilicate\u2010rich fault exhibit higher peak slip rates and greater slip displacements. We propose a microscopic mechanism to elaborate how fluids may influence mineral friction and thereby affect injection\u2010induced fault slip."

    "content": "Abstract\nMarine methane emissions are important components of natural methane budgets, but the methane emission contribution derived from the central Arctic is still unclear. Here, we measured the dissolved methane concentration and its stable carbon isotopic signature (\u03b413C\u2010CH4) while onboard a western Arctic cruise in 2024. In the shelf areas, the methane concentration was found to be 2\u20133 times higher than that at atmospheric equilibrium, corresponding to a \u03b413C\u2010CH4 value of less than \u221256.3\u2030, which suggests a methanogenic origin. In contrast, the waters in the offshore areas were under or slightly lower than atmospheric equilibrium, corresponding to more positive \u03b413C\u2010CH4 values (\u221248.4\u2030\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u2030). Persistent excess methane values in the offshore areas were detected in the water column. The mass balance suggested that the in situ production accounted for more than two\u2010thirds of the excess methane. In contrast, microbial oxidation removed over half of the methane pool. Finally, we calculated that the central Arctic can uptake 7.74\u2009\u00b1\u200911.76 Gg of methane in summer. The combined effect of sea ice melting/freezing and methane removal resulted in a 305% offset of methane diffusion, which provides evidence that the central Arctic, in contrast with the continental shelf region, currently makes a small contribution to atmospheric methane."

    "content": "Abstract\nHuman pressures are leading to the replacement of macroalgal forests by alternative opportunistic species on shallow temperate reefs. Nonetheless, the ecological consequences of habitat reconfiguration for coastal biodiversity and ecosystem functioning remain poorly quantified. By means of a field study, we compared the metabolic functioning and biodiversity of macroalgal forests dominated by the fucoid Ericaria brachycarpa at pristine sites with that of assemblages formed by a shrub\u2010like rhodophyte (i.e., Halopithys incurva) at urban sites. Dominant macroalgae at pristine and urban sites supported similar abundance and species richness of vagile invertebrates, but macroalgal forests supported higher invertebrate biomass. Shrub\u2010like assemblages at urban sites sustained an autotrophic metabolism with a net diel O2 production throughout the year, whereas macroalgal forests tended to be heterotrophic during warmer months. Diel fluxes of total dissolved inorganic carbon, as well as the contribution of production/respiration, were consistent with O2 fluxes, with E. brachycarpa forests functioning as a heterotrophic carbon source in summer. This could be the result of reduced photosynthetic performance of the dominant brown macroalga and/or increased community respiration in warmer seawater. Our findings suggest that benthic assemblages in urban areas, formed by large and architecturally complex macroalgae, do not markedly differ from those found in pristine areas in terms of supported biodiversity and may sustain a more stable autotrophic balance under varying environmental conditions. Avoiding further degradation of these urban habitats (i.e., shift from shrub\u2010like to mat\u2010like turfs) could be a viable strategy for sustaining ecosystem functioning along peri\u2010urban and urban Mediterranean coasts."

Here, we applied the eddy covariance (EC) technique to acquire 1\u2010yr (June 2023 to May 2024) NME measurements, over a subtropical macroalgae aquaculture ecosystem in southeast China, to examine the temporal variability of NME across time scales and its contribution to net radiative forcing. The results indicated that (a) this ecosystem acted as a CH4 source in most months with the summer accounting for about two\u2010thirds of annual NME of 0.40\u2009g C m\u22122\u2009yr\u22121; (b) the inclusion of annual NME increased the sustained\u2010flux global warming potentials (SGWPs) by 11.0% from 219.3 (CO2 only) to 243.4\u2009g CO2\u2010eq. m\u22122\u2009yr\u22121 for a 100\u2010yr time horizon; (c) NME and its radiative contribution varied across seasons, farming periods, and growth stages, with the temporal fluctuations mainly controlled by temperature and tidal activities; (d) bimodal varying patterns across tidal levels were identified with larger fluxes occurring when tidal level changed most rapidly. This is the first EC study to confirm that CH4 emission intensifies the warming effect of CO2 efflux from macroalgae aquaculture ecosystems. The observed strong temporal variability of CH4 and CO2 fluxes and their asynchrony highlight the importance of high\u2010frequency and continuous flux measurements in accurately assessing their net radiative forcing at both short\u2010 and long\u2010term scales."

However, there is strikingly limited empirical evidence for the environmental and ecological impacts of decommissioning. Here, we employed a meta\u2010analytical approach on an industry benthic monitoring database to investigate the benthic biodiversity and food web properties of structures sampled in the short term (<\u20091\u2009yr; scenario 1), medium term (1\u20135\u2009yr; scenario 2), and long term (>\u20095\u2009yr; scenario 3) after decommissioning. We found reduced species richness and simplified food webs in scenario 1, followed by the first signs of recovery in scenario 2, with a slightly higher proportion of intermediate species and density of food web connections. Food webs recovered further in scenario 3, with a much greater density of interactions, but also more links and longer food chains, while a reduction in generalism and connectance indicated an increased prevalence of specialist species. Our findings demonstrate disturbance risks associated with the decommissioning process in the short term, but a positive recovery trajectory over longer timescales. We highlight the importance of industry collecting more extensive and long\u2010term data at multiple time points and covering different decommissioning types, establishing a standardized data workflow for integrating with available monitoring efforts, and improving stakeholder participation and data accessibility to support an environmentally sound decommissioning process."

    "content": "Abstract\nAntarctica is a seasonally active region for marine organic sulfur cycling and ocean\u2010atmospheric sulfur fluxes. Organic sulfur compounds, such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylsulfide, produced by microbes are key chemical currencies in interspecies interactions, which in turn, underpin marine sulfur dynamics. This study examined Antarctic phytoplankton\u2010bacteria associations and their influence on marine sulfur cycling along a coastal gradient from an inner fjord of the S\u00f8rsdal glacier to the open ocean (six sites). Phytoplankton abundance increased with distance from the glacier, corresponding with an increase in dimethylsulfoniopropionate concentrations (dissolved 13\u201328\u2009nM; total 73\u2013140\u2009nM) and phytoplankton dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity. Microbial community composition varied with glacial\u2010influence, and overall abundance declined with distance from the glacier. We identified strong associations between dominant phytoplankton genera (Cylindrotheca, Corethron, Chaetoceros, Fragilariopsis, Leptocylindrus/Dactyliosolen, and Phaeocystis) and bacteria from the Rhodobacteraceae (i.e., Roseobacter group), highlighting the prevalence of these species' complexes in Antarctic waters. Specifically, pigment markers of Phaeocystis sp. and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to Octadecabacter and Sulfitobacter correlated positively with dissolved dimethylsulfoniopropionate concentrations and phytoplankton dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity, supporting their role in marine sulfur metabolism and extending the known geographical range of sulfur\u2010mediated phytoplankton associations with the Roseobacter group. In broadening the reported range of these interorganism interactions to Antarctic waters, these results extend the prevalence and weight of the role of sulfur\u2010based dependencies in structuring marine microbial communities."

    "content": "Microbial biotechnology has the potential to address several societal issues through the sustainable production of industrially relevant compounds. Despite decades of successful cases, rational engineering of microbial metabolism is still a complex process due to the fine balance between nutrient supply, allocation of cellular resources, energy demand and redox balancing. In this work, we implemented a text-mining workflow for metabolic engineering and compiled a database of experimentally validated strain design strategies from over 15.000 research articles, which includes information on host strain, target compounds, and gene modifications. This large dataset reveals trends on the selection of suitable hosts for different kinds of products and the respective gene targets. Despite the wide variety of microbes and products, we observe a conserved set of target metabolic genes associated with central carbon metabolism, especially in upper glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway, citric acid cycle, and fermentative pathways. The most distinguishing feature among strain design strategies seems not to be which genes are targeted, but rather the direction in which they are modified (increased or decreased expression). Controlling flux at key branching points and redox balancing reactions is thus a critical engineering step to steer metabolism. Our collection of 25 years of literature can provide a stepping stone for starting new strain design projects without reinventing the wheel."

    "content": "Pattern formation underlies organization and function across biological systems. A major challenge in understanding and controlling these systems lies in making accurate, photorealistic predictions of emergent patterns that reflect both the governing biophysical rules and the fine-scaled visual features observed experimentally. Such predictions are essential for interpreting experimental observations and for guiding rational design in contexts where patterning governs system behavior, such as microbial consortia, tissue morphogenesis, and spatially structured biomanufacturing. Mechanistic models can reproduce global morphological patterns but lack visual details; purely data-driven generative models produce visually plausible images that are not grounded in underlying biology. Here, we introduce a simulation-templated hybrid framework that integrates a coarse-grained, mechanistic model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colony expansion with components of a foundation image model. Using this approach, we achieve, for the first time, computationally efficient and experimentally realistic predictions of self-organized bacterial branching patterns, including fine details such as colony texture, color gradients, and replicate level variability. By combining mechanistic simulations with the expressive power of a foundation image model, our strategy offers a generalizable path for simulation-templated photorealistic prediction of biological patterns, with applications across synthetic biology, tissue morphogenesis, and other spatially structured biological and physical systems."

    "content": "Polylactic acid (PLA) is a polymer that is known to exhibit compostability at thermophilic temperatures, and this activity is thought to be connected to the presence of PLA hydrolyzability in environmental microbes. We recently developed a set of compost that can biodegrade PLA at mesophilic conditions, and one possible reason underlying our success could be due to the enrichment of PLA hydrolyzability. Here, we investigated the potential selection of bioactivities related to PLA breakdown in our trained compost and surveyed the occurrences of those activities in the environment for comparison. Ten different environments were sampled, including PLA, larval gut of black soldier flies, and organic material from our trained compost, as well as terrestrial soil, estuarine sediment, brackish water, shell biofilm, coastal stranded polystyrene, bottle, and bottle cap. We found a small fraction of cultivable bacteria in many samples that harbored PLA degradability. For our trained compost, PLA-degrading isolates were twice as efficient as those from other environments, even though the frequency at which they were detected was not significantly higher. These findings suggested that PLA breakdown ability is commonly present at a low percentage in most environments, and that our trained compost has been able to select for more effective isolates. As this enhancement is likely insufficient to explain the increase in PLA compostability in our trained compost compared to standard mesophilic composts, we propose that additional microbial activities are needed to act synergistically and overcome the requirement for elevated temperature in PLA composting."

    "content": "Background: Dental caries is the most common chronic oral disease in children, but its etiology is complex and multifactorial. The association of the oral microbiota with caries is underexplored in children. We investigated saliva microbiota in Finnish children and aimed to identify microbial biomarkers associated with the risk of having caries or fillings (CF). Methods: We examined 400 Finnish children (180 girls, 220 boys) aged 7-9 years who provided stimulated saliva samples and underwent clinical oral examinations at baseline of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study. Of these children, 261 (65%) were with CF and 139 (35%) were without CF. We characterized the saliva microbiota using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, examined differences in the abundance and composition at the phylum and genus level between these two groups, and studied the associations of selected Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with the risk of having CF in crude and adjusted (OTUs, age, Silness-Loe plaque index) models. Results: Alpha diversity and richness did not differ between the groups (p>0.1 for Shannon, inverse Simpson, and Chao1 indices) in the total sample nor when analyzed among girls and boys separately. Beta diversity differed between the groups in the total sample, and when girls and boys were analyzed separately (p corrected by false discovery rate method [pcorr] ~ 0.001). In total, 80 OTUs differed between the groups at the genus level (pcorr<0.01). Two OTUs were independently associated with the risk of having CF. A novel Parvimonas OTU was inversely associated with having CF (odds ratio [ORcrude] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.75). In addition, an OTU of probably Streptococcus mutans was positively associated with having CF (ORcrude 6.01, 95% CI 3.49 to 10.36). Conclusion: A Parvimonas species represented by a novel OTU is independently and inversely associated with the risk of having CF in children."

    "content": "Onset and progression of active tuberculosis disease result from upsetting the delicate balance between Mtb virulence and host defenses. Because it dynamically tunes the functional output of protein expression in cells, alternative splicing, a process by which different mRNAs can be generated from a single gene, is positioned to play a critical role in maintaining an equilibrated Mtb-macrophage host-pathogen interface. To gain insight into how alternative splicing shapes antimycobacterial immune responses, we used RNA-sequencing and splicing-aware computational pipelines to quantify alternative splicing in Mtb-infected bone marrow-derived murine macrophages. We found that ~5% of expressed macrophage genes exhibit one or more splicing changes at 8h post-Mtb infection, highlighting alternative splicing as a key regulatory node in the macrophage response to Mtb. We next sought to identify RNA binding proteins that play an outsized role in shaping the macrophage transcriptome during Mtb infection. We discovered that the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) promotes the early induction of inflammatory genes while dampening several type I interferon-stimulated genes in response to Mtb. HnRNPA2B1 also controls alternative splicing of many genes during Mtb infection, including Irgm1, a critical immunity-related GTPase. The balance of Irgm1-long vs. -short is differentially regulated in response to diverse inflammatory cues and macrophages overexpressing Irgm1-short are defective in autophagosomal targeting, lysosomal homeostasis, and restriction of Mtb replication. These data highlight a key role for AS in shaping the macrophage transcriptome and pinpoint hnRNPA2B1 as a novel restriction factor in the cell-intrinsic response to Mtb."

    "content": "The overuse of antibiotics in livestock is leading to the development of super-resistant pathogens, necessitating the production of probiotic feed for livestock that is also sustainable. Therefore, the study aims to ferment five mixtures of black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) and soy in different proportions with the probiotic Lactobacillus bulgaricus in order to determine which allows the greatest growth of this probiotic bacteria and represent a new feed alternative for sustainable livestock farming. To achieve this, the growth curve of Lactobacillus bulgaricus in MRS broth was determined. In the exponential growth phase, this broth was added to the five formulations of BSFLM and soy, and finally, the CFU produced by each formulation was determined. It was found that the concentration of BSFLM has a statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) on the concentration of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, with twice as many CFU of the probiotic obtained in the pure HLMSN treatment than in the pure soy treatment. These results reveal that Lactobacillus bulgaricus is capable of metabolizing and producing greater biomass with BSFLM as a substrate instead of soy, so this formulation can be used in subsequent studies for in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial testing."

    "content": "Poly(A) tails are present on most cellular and viral mRNAs, providing a platform for poly(A)-binding proteins that stimulate translation and regulate the deadenylation and stability of transcripts in the cytoplasm. Here we leverage nanopore direct RNA sequencing to analyse the distribution of poly(A) tail lengths on cellular and viral mRNAs across Herpesviridae and other DNA and RNA virus infections. We find that herpesvirus mRNA poly(A) tails are consistently longer than those on cellular and other viral transcripts, presenting a previously unrecognized yet widespread mechanism to advantage herpesviral gene expression. This contrasts with the templated poly(A) tails on coronavirus RNAs and those on cytoplasmically transcribed poxviral mRNAs, which are more similar in length to those on host mRNAs. Herpesviral noncoding RNAs display differential poly(A) tailing patterns which do not correlate with nuclear localisation while individual herpesviral mRNAs also show variation in the extent to which their poly(A) tail lengths change during the virus lifecycle, suggestive of additional uncharacterised layers of poly(A) tail length regulation. Importantly, while we detect non-adenosine nucleotides within herpesviral poly(A) tails, which are known to oppose deadenylase activity, this mixed tailing is not at sufficient frequency to explain the widespread extended tails of herpesvirus mRNAs."

Their production extends beyond the Mediterranean basin and the transformation of different olive varieties according to various trade preparations results in high product diversity. Several varieties have Protected Designation of Origin, and, in Italy the black naturally fermented Oliva di Gaeta is prominent. In order to understand the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities and how it is affected by olive variety, olive ripeness and trade preparation, we carried out a survey using 364 samples from 40 producers and 6 countries. We measured pH, salt concentration, viable counts and carried out amplicon targeted metagenomics of bacterial and fungal communities. Olive variety, olive ripeness and trade preparation all significantly affected the diversity and composition of bacterial and fungal communities but dispersal plays a confounding role: even within the same variety we found significant differences between producing firms and a large variability even within the same firm. This may be due to limited control of contamination (with house microbiota playing a role in initial contamination events) and of technological factors and also to the widespread use of relatively small fermenters (240-280 L). This variability obscured the differences that existed between PDO (Oliva di Gaeta) and non PDO (Itrana nera) black naturally fermented olives of the Itrana variety. Nonetheless, we were able to identify subset of bacterial and fungal genera which were differentially abundant in selected trade preparations and confirmed that the diversity of lactic acid bacteria communities of naturally fermented olives."

    "content": "Mycobacterium abscessus is a drug-resistant pathogen associated with poor clinical outcomes despite treatment with multidrug antibiotic regimens. Apart from clarithromycin, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results for Mycobacterium abscessus cannot guide antibiotic selection. AST involves measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is allowed to span a four-fold range in concentration. This accepted variability of the MIC limits the clinical utility of AST. Antimicrobial dose-response curves, obtained by measuring the growth inhibition of a given organism to increasing concentrations of an antibiotic, can yield metrics of antibiotic activity that are less variable than the MIC. We used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute growth conditions for rapid-grower nontuberculous mycobacteria to generate 990 dose-response curves across three time points (72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours) for six guideline-recommended (clarithromycin, amikacin, cefoxitin, linezolid, tigecycline, and clofazimine) and five new (omadacycline, tedizolid, SPR719, SQ109, and bedaquiline) antibiotics against Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies abscessus ATCC 19977 and Mycobacterium peregrinum ATCC 700686. We established the fit of the dose-response curve (R2) as a quality control metric. Using the geometric standard deviation and median coefficient of variation, we demonstrated that the IC50 and IC75 (antibiotic concentrations corresponding to 50% and 75% growth inhibition, respectively) are less variable than the MIC. We identified time-dependent changes in dose-response curve metrics that allow the detection of inducible clarithromycin resistance with only five days of incubation. This study demonstrates the potential of dose-response curves in measuring antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium abscessus."

Yet, a holistic understanding of the impact of different succession stage on the karst soil microbiome is still poorly understood. Here, we used a field experiment to investigate the long-term consequences of changes in succession stage: rocky desertification(RD), grassland(GL), shrubs(SH), forest plantation(FP) and natural forest(NF)  based on plant frequency on bacteria, protist and fungal communities. We showed that the shannon index of bacteria and fungi were higher in NF compared to GL, while protist shannon index was higher in SH that GL. The bacterial simpson_e index in NF and PF were higher than that in GL, SH and RD, howerer fungal and protist simpson_e index were similar across the five succession stages. Significant differences were observed in observed outs and phylogenetic diversity index in NF, SH were higher than GL, RD for fungi and protist, whereas bacterial observed outs and phylogenetic diversity index were relatively similar in five succession stage. The five succession stage differed markedly in the compositions of bacterial, fungi and protist communities. In bacterial, dominant phyla were Actinobacteriota, Proteoprotist, Acidobacteriota. Protist communities were dominated by Phragmoplastophyta, Arthropoda phyla. Regarding protist taxa, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Our findings provided evidence indicating that the microbial community compositions of RD, GL, SH, PF, and NF have their respective characteristics. These characteristics stem from differences in vegetation coverage, plant debris, root formation and other factors, leading to changes in the diversity and taxonomic group of bacteria, fungi and protists at different successional stages. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive perspective, showing the differences in microbial communities at different successional stages in karst soil."

By combining longitudinal sampling and analysis of Enterobacterales and associated phages isolated from the human gut, with experimental evolution, our work identifies mechanisms that underpin observed patterns of temperate phage-bacteria co-existence and bacterial resistance in this clinically relevant microbiome. Specifically, we show that limited phage infectivity observed against sympatric and allopatric hosts can be explained by the prevalence of spontaneous prophage induction (SPI) bacterial phenotypes and ecological shifts and turnover in focal host populations at multiple taxonomic levels. Despite the ubiquity of temperate phages in the human gut, these findings challenge the assumption that they are major drivers of within-host bacterial evolution and diversification over short-time scales in this natural ecosystem."

Here we cross two genetically distinct but highly syntenic sympatric strains of Sulfolobus (Saccharolobus) islandicus and identify the pattern of recombination across the archaeal chromosome. We quantify recombination breakpoints occurring at neutral chromosomal markers through high-throughput short read Illumina sequencing of selected recombinant strains. We focus on three datasets that provide different, but corroborating information: i) individual colony sequences, ii) large colony pools of strains sorted by background genotype, and iii) a large colony pool of combined background genotypes. For each dataset we apply a newly designed and optimized computational tool called MARBL (Multiply Anchored Recombination Breakpoint Locator) for quantifying breakpoints and testing their statistical significance relative to sources of error introduced by sequencing technology. By combining the results of each dataset, we determine the short tract recombination preference in this organism and discuss its implications for mechanisms of recombination in archaea. We demonstrate uniform rates of recombination throughout the chromosome, which differ from previous studies of natural variation and discuss this in light of previous data suggesting speciation occurs through selection against inter-species hybrids."

Reverse transcriptase-associated defense systems of the UG family are widespread across bacterial lineages, yet their ecological roles remain largely undefined. Within this family, UG5 systems are distinguished by reverse transcriptases fused to or associated with a nitrilase domain. Here, we combine phylogenetic, metagenomic, and functional analyses to investigate the evolutionary context and antiviral activity of UG5-associated sys-tems. Phylogenetic analysis of 728 nitrilase domains places UG5-associated ni-trilases within a well-supported UG-related radiation encompassing the UG1, UG5, and UG6 families, with UG1 nested within a broader UG5 lineage. Meta-genomic analysis further revealed UG5-associated reverse transcriptases in soil- and rhizosphere-derived metagenomes. Based on this observation, we character-ized a UG5-large RT-associated system, here designated DRT11, encoded on the pSymA megaplasmid of Sinorhizobium meliloti RMO17, a nitrogen-fixing symbi-ont of Medicago sativa. Despite lacking the transmembrane protein typical of ca-nonical UG5-large architectures, DRT11 confers protection against naturally oc-curring M. sativa rhizosphere phages with Podoviridae-like morphology. Phage infection assays reveal protection at low multiplicities of infection, consistent with an abortive-infection-like mechanism. Moreover, mutational analyses demonstrate that antiviral activity requires only the RT and its fused C-terminal nitrilase do-main, establishing DRT11 as a minimal UG5-associated antiviral system."

In this context, Universal-Bac3Gel represents a new generation of 3D biomaterials designed to mimic the properties of human mucus and biofilm features, including micro-gradients that replicate the heterogeneous environments colonized by microorganisms in the human body. To evaluate the suitability of Universal-Bac3Gel for studying clinically relevant species in antimicrobial resistance, the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae) were cultured within this 3D environment. Bacterial growth was monitored at 24- and 48-hours post-inoculation via spot plating, while viability, distribution and organization were assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. All ESKAPE strains successfully grew throughout the structure of Universal-Bac3Gel. Distinct 3D biofilm architectures were observed across species, ranging from diffuse colonization to compact microcolony formation, in agreement with species-specific biofilm patterns. Notably, the platform's ready-to-use 96-well format allowed direct comparison of these high-priority pathogens under identical conditions, highlighting species-specific biofilm traits that would be difficult to discern in traditional 2D or animal models. This work highlights the versatility of Universal-Bac3Gel as a platform for studying pathogen colonization under a biofilm-relevant environment and underscores its potential for translational applications, including antimicrobial drug testing, personalized medicine, and reduction of animal model use in preclinical research."

    "content": "Background The mosquito gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining its capacity to transmit harmful viruses and parasites. Accordingly, manipulating mosquito gut microbiota is a promising avenue toward reducing mosquito-borne human pathogen transmission. A successful microbial control campaign will require a thorough understanding of how bacteria are transmitted through mosquito populations. Through two parallel but complementary studies using the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti as a focal host species, we surveyed vertical transmission of bacteria from individual mothers to cohorts of offspring maintained in a closed system. Results Laboratory- and field-derived mothers deposited bacteria that support offspring development, and the relative abundance of commonly transmitted taxa correlated with offspring fitness. Maternally transmitted bacteria were detected in both larval and adult offspring, and the relative abundances of specific taxa differed between life stages. Microbiota composition in adult offspring closely resembled microbiota composition in mothers, despite dramatic shifts in the relative abundance of specific microbial community members during the larval stage. Variability in microbiota composition in offspring was also greater than variability across the population of egg-laying mothers. Eggs that underwent a period of desiccation before hatching produced larval communities dominated by endospore-forming bacteria that were rare in maternal samples. Conclusions Overall, our results demonstrate the vertical transmission of mosquito-associated microbiota across generations, including bacterial taxa that could potentially be leveraged for mosquito and mosquito-borne disease control."

We investigated several routes of MPXV Clade IIb virus infection (intranasal, oral, anal, and intraperitoneal) and found high and prolonged viral titres in the testes after IP inoculation still detectable at 21 days. The testes had significant changes to tissue architecture including loss of spermatogenesis, disorganization of spermatozoa, loss of Leydig cells, and breakdown of the seminiferous tubule membranes. Viral antigen positive cells were present in the interstitial spaces between the seminiferous tubules with macrophage infiltration also evident.

Concerns of HPAIV causing high mortality of seabirds and mammals prompted immediate efforts to track its spread and impact on endemic wildlife. In March 2024, we visited the Danger Islands archipelago, that hosts two mega-colonies of Adelie penguins, and observed an unusual mortality estimated in thousands of Adelie penguins and other species. Swabs and tissues were collected for molecular detection of infectious agents from 49 carcasses, and additional tissues for histology from a selection of 9 carcasses. We unexpectedly detected Pasteurella multocida DNA in 46 of 49 individuals, and diagnosed avian cholera, and not HPAI, as the cause of death of most of these animals. By metagenomics, we retrieved the genomic sequences of the Pasteurella multocida strain which caused the epizootic, and the phylogenetic analysis showed a close relation with strains previously reported in the Southern Ocean area. This study confirms avian cholera as a relevant cause of mortality in the Antarctic region, and overall highlights the importance of considering avian cholera in the differential diagnoses during mortality events in Antarctica, even with the concurrent circulation of HPAIV."

Recently, dietary interventions targeted at restoring microbial balance have therefore gained attention as potential therapeutic strategies. We recently demonstrated that an encapsulated synbiotic containing high-oleic palm oil and Limosilactobacillus fermentum K73 can modulate the metabolic activity and composition of human-derived gut microbiota in an in vitro batch bioreactor. Here, we extended this work through an in vivo supplementation pilot study using gnotobiotic mice colonized with gut microbiota from Colombian pediatric patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or age-matched neurotypical (NT) donors. Behavioral assessments and analyses of gut microbiota composition and function were performed before and after synbiotic supplementation. First, we found that the gut microbiota from Colombian ASD patients exhibited significantly reduced richness relative to NT donors, consistent with reports from other geographical regions, and displayed distinct compositional features unique to this population. Humanization of the gnotobiotic mice with this donor microbiota was successful, with murine gut communities reflecting features of their corresponding donor microbiota. Notably, synbiotic supplementation induced significant increases in the abundance of beneficial taxa and the production of short chain fatty acids that were more pronounced in mice colonized with ASD-derived microbiota, with concurrent behavioral changes associated with beneficial modulation of gut microbiota. Overall, we provide evidence that supports synbiotic supplementation as a viable strategy to positively modulate gut microbiome in conditions of dysbiosis. Our study also expands the body of knowledge of gut microbiome to understudied populations such as Latin America."

Using a radial diffusion assay and resazurin-based viability testing, C14R exhibited potent bactericidal effect with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits visible growth of planktonic microorganisms, ranging from 3.4 {micro}g/mL (Enterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant) to 45.2 {micro}g/mL (Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, ESBL). C14R also inhibited biofilm formation by Gram-positive pathogens, with minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs), referring to the minimal concentration required to prevent the development of biofilms, of 15.0 {micro}g/mL (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) and 22.0 {micro}g/mL (E. faecium, VRE), whereas Gram-negatives biofilms showed higher tolerance.

    "content": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome. Conserved sequence elements within the 5'- and 3'-non-coding regions (NCRs) of the CHIKV genome interact with host proteins to regulate viral RNA replication. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and mass spectrometry identified several host RNA-binding proteins that associate with these conserved NCR elements, among which EWSR1 uniquely bound the 3'-ends of both the plus-sense genomic RNA and the minus-sense replication intermediate RNA. EMSA and biolayer interferometry demonstrated that EWSR1 binds strongly to two RNA elements: a 48-nucleotide region in the plus-strand 3'-NCR (3NCR48) and a 50-nucleotide region at the 3'-end of the minus-strand replication intermediate (5NCR-RC50), which is complementary to the genome's 5'-NCR and its adjacent sequence. RNA immunoprecipitation from CHIKV-infected cells confirmed that EWSR1 binds CHIKV RNA in vivo. Functional analyses revealed that CHIKV infection downregulates EWSR1 expression and causes its cytoplasmic accumulation. Knockdown or knockout of EWSR1 expression increased CHIKV genomic RNA levels and viral titers, whereas its overexpression suppressed both. EWSR1 reduced the synthesis of both plus- and minus-sense CHIKV RNAs in infected cells. Additionally, EWSR1 was found to bind CHIKV nsP2 and inhibit its helicase activity, which is critical for viral genome replication. The antiviral activity of EWSR1 extended to Ross River virus but not to Sindbis virus, consistent with conservation of the 48-nucleotide sequence in their respective 3'-NCRs. Together, these findings identify EWSR1 as a novel host restriction factor that limits CHIKV replication through specific interactions with viral RNA and the nsP2 protein."

    "content": "The human pathogenic orthoflavivirus St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) reemerged in the western United States in 2015 after more than a decade of apparent absence and has since expanded throughout California with sustained, interannual transmission. This shift from the historically sporadic pattern of SLEV activity prior to 2003 raises the question of whether contemporary SLEV strains differ in fitness in Culex vectors compared with earlier strains. To determine whether reemerging SLEV possess augmented infectivity and transmissibility that may have facilitated reestablishment, we compared the vector competence of five genotype III SLEV strains detected in California between 2016 and 2023 with a historic genotype V strain from 2003. Laboratory colonies of the two primary California vectors, Culex (Cx.) tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus, were orally exposed to bloodmeals containing 3, 5, or 6.7 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL of SLEV, and infection, dissemination, and transmission were assessed 13-14 days later by quantifying SLEV RNA in individual mosquitoes. Both species exhibited strong dose-dependent responses, with minimal infection at 3 log10 PFU/mL and uniformly high infection, dissemination, and saliva positivity at 6.7 log10 PFU/mL. At 5 log10 PFU/mL, genotype III strains infected Cx. quinquefasciatus more efficiently than the historical 2003 strain, which failed to infect this species. In Cx. tarsalis, fitness differences among SLEV strains were more modest and strain-specific. These findings demonstrate that multiple genotype III SLEV strains exhibit equal or greater vector infectivity in Cx. quinquefasciatus than the 2003 genotype V strain, suggesting that enhanced fitness in this vector may contribute to the persistence and geographic spread of SLEV in California since its reemergence and underscoring the need for continued vector surveillance and targeted control efforts to reduce SLEV transmission to humans."

    "content": "There is extensive debate on supplemental bird feeding given the mixed evidence about its effects on avian taxa. In this study, we quantified feeder use in the Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) from a population in Central Spain using radio frequency identification (RFID) with the aim of unravelling its determinants and consequences. We found extensive variation in feeder use, both individually and temporally. Individuals that made use of feeders later spent more time feeding. Feeder use did not explain variation in reproductive success in our population. Our study indicates that inter-individual differences combined with seasonality are the main determinants of feeder use."

    "content": "Introduction: Timing of birth is a major determinant of individuals reproductive success and survival, and is driven by multiple internal and external factors. However, there is currently no quantitative assessment of the extent and support received by the drivers of the phenology of births in mammals. Due to their diverse phenology of births, large herbivores represent an ideal case study to quantify this. Aims: our objective was to identify the different drivers tested for their effect on the phenology of births in large herbivores and how much empirical support they received, as well as determine thematic, taxonomic and spatial gaps in the literature. Methods: We conducted a systematic review focusing on the drivers of the phenology of births in wild large herbivores. We extracted the outcomes of 124 relevant articles and assessed the reliability of their findings using a general index based on the quality of the data and methods used. Results and Discussion: As expected, the two dominant hypotheses (seasonality and predation) received strong support regarding their effect on birth timing and synchrony, respectively. The effect of female, offspring and population characteristics remained marginally accounted for, even though there was evidence of their importance in the determination of the phenology of births. We identified a major research gap in Asian and South and Central American species. Conclusions: We encourage research in these understudied domains, as well as large scale multi-species comparative analyses to fill in the gaps and improve our understanding of reproductive phenology."

    "content": "Latitudinal changes in environmental conditions shape the evolution of avian life history traits: tropical bird species typically exhibiting prolonged breeding seasons, a slower pace of life, lower annual investment in reproduction and increased annual survival compared to their temperate counterparts. Major shifts in physiology, reflecting these differences, are expected to be mediated by endocrine regulation, yet comparative data on the sources of inter-specific variation in hormone concentrations remain sparse, especially outside the Nearctic-Neotropic system. We examined variation in two key steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, across 100 passerine species from Europe and the Afrotropics, sampled using standardized field protocols. Baseline levels of both hormones were consistently lower in tropical species, as expected. While stress-induced corticosterone reactivity did not differ between latitudes, it declined with migration distance. Testosterone levels were higher in males than females and declined with migration distance. In tropical species, neither hormone was associated with elevation, another source of environmental variation, but both varied during the breeding cycle, challenging the view of tropical aseasonality. This study broadens the perspective on endocrine correlates of avian life history evolution by testing their generality in an understudied Afrotropical-Palearctic system. The results support the hypothesis that steroid hormone profiles co-evolve with latitude."

    "content": "Rosewoods account for up to 40% of the global illegal wildlife trade, with Dalbergia cochinchinensis (Siamese rosewood) being the most heavily exploited species in Southeast Asia. Its survival is further threatened by intensifying drought linked to climate change and hydrological alteration. Here we combine greenhouse drought experiments across six provenances with full-length cDNA-seq to uncover how water-relations and carbon-use strategies vary within this species. Multivariate trait analysis resolves a two-dimensional isohydry space: a water-flux stringency axis (gs-E) largely orthogonal to a carbon-economics axis (A-WUEi). Provenances differed strikingly, where two (KKH, DN) showed a rare E{downarrow}A{uparrow} response, achieving high WUEi and maintaining growth under drought. Contrary to expectation, precipitation of the wettest month, not the driest, predicted isohydry, indicating that wet-season conditions set a developmental and hydrological floor for later drought responses. We identified 76 drought-responsive genes and two genes associated with isohydry axes, a poorly characterised Notch-like protein, AT4G14746, and SEOR1. We also detected provenance-specific isoform switches, where drought favoured a PRX52 isoform lacking its signal peptide in the anisohydric provenance THB, and functional coding isoforms of ANN3 and LTPG5 in NP. These results reveal previously hidden diversity in drought strategies, identify mechanism-anchored markers for screening, and provide a simple climatic lever for climate-adjusted provenancing. We reveal post-transcriptional regulation as a novel candidate substrate for local adaptation in a threatened tropical tree, directly linking ecophysiology, climate and genomes for conservation and restoration."

    "content": "Tracing the introduction, spread, and evolution of non-native species is crucial for risk assessment and management. Spiders represent one of the largest groups of terrestrial arthropod predators, and an increasing number of species have been introduced globally, posing growing challenges to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Yet, their global introduction routes, spatial diversity patterns, and evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a global-scale survey of 53,172 taxon records and updated the checklist of North American spiders to 5,401 species, including 118 non-native species. By integrating historical records with species occurrence data, we reconstructed the geographic origins of non-native species and found that most originated from Asia and Europe, consistent with long-standing transcontinental trade and intensive human activities. Mapping the contemporary distributions of all non-native species revealed at least six richness hotspots, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas, underscoring strong associations between non-native spider accumulation and population density, trade intensity, and human-mediated dispersal pathways. By analyzing genomes of 45 native and five non-native spider species within North America, we detected a set of metabolic, stress tolerance and immune defense genes under positive selection and rapid evolution in non-native species, suggesting that putative functional innovations may contribute to their establishment, expansion, and ongoing local adaptation. Altogether, our study provides the most comprehensive survey to date of introduction routes, spatial dynamics, and evolutionary signatures of non-native spiders in North America, and highlights putative mechanisms that may facilitate arthropod introductions under global change."

    "content": "Automated detection and classification of species vocalisations offers the potential to utilise acoustic datasets across unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, classification algorithms inevitably generate errors, and error rates vary with context. While methods for quantifying error rates in ecoacoustics are well established, there is limited research on what level of model performance is sufficient to reliably determine avian vocalisation patterns. Using an extensive fully expert-labelled acoustic dataset from Peru (18 hours, 6 sites), we examined changes in the probability of detecting target bird vocalisations in the first hour after dawn to address three key questions: (1) How sensitive are models predicting detection probability over time to reductions in classification accuracy? (2) To what extent does aggregating detections over longer time periods impact classification accuracy? Additionally, we used the labelled dataset to assess how the creation and composition of a test dataset for assessing classifier performance can impact the reliability of accuracy metrics: (3) Are estimates of classification precision robust when test and deployment datasets are not independent and identically distributed? Our results indicate that poor classification performance - especially low precision - can lead to misleading inferences about temporal patterns of vocalisations. Aggregating classifier predictions over longer time periods improved recall but often resulted in misleading patterns of vocal behaviour by reducing precision and temporal resolution. We also demonstrate that precision can be substantially overestimated when species presences are rarer in the deployment dataset than in test data. These findings highlight the importance of cautious application of automated classification in acoustic ecology and the need for accuracy assessment methods tailored to the intended ecological analysis."

    "content": "Life history is key to understanding macroecological patterns. Measurable characteristics are particularly critical to the study of ecology. These quantifiable traits can be compared between numerous taxonomic clades to examine how evolutionary forces have shaped biological systems. Although numerous in-depth studies have focused on assessing the life histories of mammalian and avian taxa, few scientific endeavors have addressed the diversity of measurable reproductive characteristics in other vertebrate clades. Here we present the first work examine the macroecology of life history traits in serpentine reptiles and amphibians. Both chosen clades comprise taxa that are limbless, predatory, and primarily restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes. To test the hypothesis that phylogeny limits the extent to which life-history may overlap, the body mass, lifespan, hatchling size, and clutch size of serpentine amphibians and reptiles will be compared using statistical inference methods (t-tests). The distributions of body mass, lifespan, hatchling size, and clutch size differ among serpentine reptiles and amphibians. Linear models suggest that how hatchling and clutch size vary with body mass also differ between the two. Only the linear model examining how lifespan varies with body mass indicates that broad similarities in life histories exist between serpentine amphibians and reptiles. Our results, that little overlap exists in life-history, suggest that the same macroevolutionary processes that allow serpentine amphibian and reptile ecological niche regimes to converge are not acting on their quantifiable life-history traits."

    "content": "Culex mosquitoes are important vectors of West Nile virus, and, as small-bodied ectotherms, are sensitive to temperature. This is especially important for juvenile stages which are confined to the body of water where they hatched and are unable to relocate for thermoregulation. In an urban desert like Maricopa County, Arizona, the macroclimate is strongly influenced by the urban heat island effect where larval thermal maxima are frequently exceeded. Understanding the local temperatures (microclimates) of sites that mosquitoes chose for egg-laying and larval development is important for managing mosquito populations and reducing disease risk. We deployed small temperature loggers at multiple breeding sites throughout the city and compared those temperatures to gridded reanalysis macroclimate data. We found that the recorded aquatic microclimates were consistently cooler than corresponding macroclimates, and that higher canopy cover further buffered hot temperatures. This suggests that using interpolated macroclimate data to estimate mosquito population dynamics overestimates the thermal stress local mosquitoes actually experience. By using microclimate measures we can better predict mosquito survival and development, allowing us to better understand disease risk both now and with future warming."

    "content": "Understanding variation in age at maturity is important for endangered species recovery because older, larger adults contribute disproportionately to the next generation. Conditions in early life stages may have underappreciated impacts on age at maturity. Our study objective was to associate adult age of individually tagged wild, spring/summer Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) outmigrating from the Snake River (Idaho and Washington, USA) in 1998-2020 with covariates measured during juvenile and subadult stages. We used a hierarchical Bayesian ordinal probit regression model to estimate statistical effects of juvenile body length, seasonal migration timing or river temperature, transported or in-river hydrosystem passage, river flow, and a large-scale ocean index. Results indicated notable carryover effects consistent with underlying biological mechanisms related to growth and development, in which shorter juvenile length and later seasonal migration timing were associated with older adults. These biological and behavioural factors were more important than riverine or marine environmental conditions examined. Our study suggests that managers and decision makers should consider carryover effects from the juvenile life stage on age structure in conjunction with survival."

    "content": "The increase in the frequency and severity of drought-induced tree mortality in many European low-elevation forests poses considerable challenges to forest management and requires an understanding of its causes. We propose a novel framework for integrating the factors underlying drought-induced tree mortality in a dynamic vegetation model. We evaluate whether this framework accurately reproduces drought-related mortality in six mesic beech-dominated stands in 2018-2020, and over multiple years in a xeric Scots pine-dominated stand in Switzerland. Additionally, we investigate its behavior along a large climatic gradient in central Europe. We employ a three-step approach. First, we evaluate multiple drought indices for capturing tree growth responses to extreme drought. We find that in contrast to widespread indices such as SPI and SPEI, the ForClim drought index captures growth responses to drought intensity during summer, the growing period, and annually. Second, we assess in detail the capability of the ForClim soil moisture model to simulate soil water dynamics, comparing it to the mechanistic soil-vegetation-atmosphere model LWFBrook90. The ForClim soil moisture model adequately simulates soil water dynamics, particularly in extreme drought years. Third, based on Manion Decline Disease Theory, we develop a novel mortality sub-model that combines predisposing and inciting factors. Its integration in ForClim captures drought-induced mortality events in the mesic beech forests as well as the multi-year mortality at the xeric Scots pine-dominated stand. Along a climatic gradient in central Europe, the model provides good quantifications of Potential Natural Vegetation. The novel framework to capture drought-related tree mortality is simple yet produces accurate results. The underlying hypothesis regarding the factors leading to drought-induced tree mortality is promising but requires further tests for its generality."
