    "content": "Abstract\nThe ocean plays a major role in controlling atmospheric carbon at decadal to millennial timescales, with benthic carbon representing the only geologic\u2010scale storage of oceanic carbon. Despite its importance, detailed benthic ocean observations are limited and representation of the benthic carbon cycle in ocean and Earth system models (ESMs) is mostly empirical with little prognostic capacity, which hinders our ability to properly understand the long\u2010term evolution of the carbon cycle and climate change\u2010related feedbacks. The Benthic Ecosystem and Carbon Synthesis (BECS) working group, with the support of the US Ocean Carbon & Biogeochemistry Program (OCB), identified key challenges limiting our understanding of benthic systems, opportunities to act on these challenges, and pathways to increase the representation of these systems in global modeling and observational efforts. We propose a set of priorities to advance mechanistic understanding and better quantify the importance of the benthos: (a) implementing a model intercomparison exercise with existing benthic models to support future model development, (b) data synthesis to inform both model parameterizations and future observations, (c) increased deployment of platforms and technologies in support of in situ benthic monitoring (e.g., from benchtop to field mesocosm), and (d) global coordination of a benthic observing program (\u201cGEOSed\u201d) to fill large regional data gaps and evaluate the mechanistic understanding of benthic processes acquired throughout the previous steps. Addressing these priorities will help inform solutions to both global and regional resource management and climate adaptation strategies."

(B) CCA act as sources of bacterial taxa that can establish and persist in adult E. singularis holobionts, independently of climate change effects.\n\nABSTRACT\nCrustose coralline algae (CCA) and their bacterial communities can emit chemical cues favoring coral larval settlement. Indeed, larvae of Eunicella singularis (white gorgonian) preferentially settle on CCA. Here, we investigated the effect of two Mediterranean CCA holobionts, Macroblastum dendrospermum and Lithophyllum stictiforme, on E. singularis larvae settlement and their bacterial communities, after warming and acidification treatments. We exposed CCA to temperature and pH expected for 2100 (SSP5\u20108.5) and to a marine heatwave event. Larval settlement increased 1.8\u20132.7 times in the presence of CCA exposed to warming and acidification compared to non\u2010exposed CCA. High abundance of bacteria belonging to the Pirellulaceae family was observed in all CCA, while a higher abundance of monosaccharides was found in exudates of exposed CCA. Based on CCA\u2010related 16S rDNA metabarcoding and metabolomics results, we hypothesize that the enhanced larval settlement was driven by the Pirellulaceae breakdown and utilization of CCA polysaccharides, in combination with polysaccharide release through the CCA cell walls likely augmented by decalcification. Furthermore, CCA acted as sources of bacterial taxa that may establish and persist in the adult E. singularis holobiont, independently of climate change effects. We conclude that CCA are key for E. singularis recruitment success, especially under future climate conditions, and contribute to their microbiome development."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Tibetan Plateau, known as the Third Pole, is experiencing rapid warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which profoundly influences the growth of crops such as highland barley. However, it remains unclear how highland barley photosynthesis quantitatively responds to changes in CO2 concentration and how the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship responds to warming on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we examined the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship of highland barley leaves at the heading stage and its developmental response to experimental warming (+1 and +2\u00b0C). The photosynthetic CO2 saturation concentration (Ca,sat) of highland barley leaves was 1,208.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0533.4\u00a0ppm, exceeding the current atmospheric CO2 concentration (419.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0ppm in 2022, Waliguan). Experimental warming did not significantly affect the maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax, 39.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 s\u22121), Ca,sat (1,208.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0533.4\u00a0ppm), the CO2 compensation concentration (Ca,com, 58.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.8\u00a0ppm), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax, 142.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121), and the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax, 193.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.0\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121) at a measurement temperature of 25\u00b0C. At +2\u00b0C warming, the carotenoid content of highland barley leaves increased by 5%\u201321%, whereas chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents were not significantly affected. Our findings highlight that the CO2 fertilization effect on highland barley leaf photosynthesis is expected to continue and experimental warming may developmentally influence highland barley leaf photosynthesis by altering the leaf carotenoid content rather than the photosynthesis\u2010CO2 relationship."

Although Arctic warming and sea ice retreat have been well\u2010documented, the influence of tropical Atlantic SST on Arctic sea ice remains understudied. Using reanalysis data sets and model simulations, we demonstrate that tropical Atlantic warming significantly reduces Beaufort Sea SIC. This warming triggers a Rossby wave train that propagates northeastward, altering the high\u2010latitude atmospheric circulation and inducing southerly flow anomalies. These anomalies enhance moisture transport, increase cloud cover, and amplify downward longwave radiation accelerating sea ice melt. Our findings, supported by Community Atmosphere Model version 5 and Community Earth System Model simulations, highlight the crucial role of tropical\u2010Arctic teleconnections in Arctic sea ice variability."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nUnderstanding how dispersal impacts the genetic makeup of populations is essential for predicting their responses to environmental change. Gene flow\u2014via within\u2010population dispersal and external immigration\u2014shapes population health and evolutionary potential by boosting genetic diversity, but it can also counteract local adaptation. We investigate these processes in a population of great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, United Kingdom. This system represents a large, continuous population of a vagile, widely distributed species. Using a comprehensive social pedigree alongside two genomic datasets, one with 949 individuals genotyped at 600,000 SNPs and another with 2644 individuals typed at 10,000 SNPs, we demonstrate spatial genetic structure largely driven by the spatial and temporal clustering of close kin. We quantify how temporally persistent this pattern is and find that relatedness declines with geographic distance in a consistent manner across years, without a consistent genetic basis, a pattern which is frequently renewed due to high population turnover. Immigrants make up a substantial portion of the breeding population, yet are often assumed to be genetically distinct, unrelated and outbred\u2014assumptions that can bias population inferences. We show that immigrants are indeed outbred, as are local birds; have fewer close relatives within the population, and are less likely to be related to their neighbours than locally born birds. Despite low FST and no clear genome\u2010wide population structure, immigrants and locals can be distinguished above chance using a Random Forest classifier trained on SNP data. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dispersal, population turnover and spatial population structure, and suggests that great tits in Wytham Woods experience substantial gene flow within the population and from immigrants, maintaining high genetic diversity and reducing the possibility of local adaptation at this spatial scale."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nSalinity\u2014an essential factor shaping marine species distributions\u2014is rapidly shifting due to global change, yet the mechanisms of salinity tolerance and adaptation remain poorly understood. We investigated local adaptation in the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa, a broadly distributed marine species that thrives in the brackish Baltic Sea. Using a common\u2010garden design, we compared physiological and transcriptomic responses to low salinity between populations from the North Sea (>\u200925 PSU) and the Baltic Sea (<\u200915 PSU). Baltic copepods exhibited significantly higher survival under low salinity, indicating local adaptation. While both populations shared a core osmoregulatory strategy involving active ion transport and regulation of amino acids, transcriptomic profiles revealed population\u2010specific differences. Baltic individuals showed a reduced overall gene expression response, yet maintained higher relative expression of osmoregulatory genes\u2014suggesting a more efficient and primed transcriptomic response. In contrast, North Sea copepods exhibited broader transcriptional shifts, including downregulation of metabolic and developmental pathways after prolonged stress exposure, possibly reflecting energy conservation mechanisms. These findings reveal that A. tonsa possesses both a plastic osmoregulatory strategy and population\u2010level adaptation that enable survival in extreme salinity conditions. While both populations tolerate short\u2010term exposure to low salinity, local adaptation has enhanced the Baltic population's resilience. This suggests that A. tonsa is broadly tolerant of moderate climate\u2010driven salinity declines across most of its distribution. However, our data also indicate potential range contractions in the lowest salinity zones of the Baltic Sea, underscoring the importance of identifying physiological and genetic thresholds in climate resilience studies."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe heavy reliance on pyrethroid\u2010based interventions has largely driven insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, accelerating the spread of resistant strains, including resistant Anopheles funestus strains. The efficacy of insecticide\u2010based interventions, especially insecticide\u2010treated nets (ITNs), the cornerstone of malaria control and management, is threatened by the widespread occurrence of resistance, jeopardising malaria control efforts. Alpha\u2010cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid, is increasingly utilised in various ITN formulations, including those combined with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and chlorfenapyr\u2010based Interceptor G2 (IG2) nets, to enhance effectiveness against resistant mosquito populations. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of resistance is essential to monitor and track resistance trends for an effective malaria control program. In this study, we identified a 1.4\u2009Mb QTL on the telomeric end of the left arm of chromosome 2, conferring resistance to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin (rap1 QTL). Different crossing schemes and sequencing approaches were explored to determine the most effective strategy. Individual\u2010based QTL mapping performed on segregating individuals from an isofemale family identified a QTL at the F7 generation. Higher recombination density relative to the physical genome in the F7 isofemale family, with a recombination every 240\u2009kb, facilitated the detection of a QTL compared to the F2 family (335\u2009kb/cM). Additionally, we exploited bulk segregant analysis (BSA) between susceptible and resistant phenotypes from the F7 isofemale family and an F7 mixed cross\u2010family to perform cost\u2010effective and rapid QTL\u2010mapping discovery. The strongest signal in both independent BSA analyses overlaps with the rap1 QTL, further supporting its role in \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin resistance. The known resistant alleles of the cytochrome P450 CYP6P9a and 6.5\u2010kb structural variant within the rap1 QTL strongly correlate with survival to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin. In this study, we validated that previously developed DNA\u2010based assays, originally designed to monitor permethrin resistance, are effective for tracking resistance to \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin as well. Additionally, we identified candidate variants that can serve as reliable markers for monitoring \u03b1\u2010cypermethrin resistance."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nAquatic insects are the most biodiverse freshwater animals. DNA metabarcoding data are increasingly used to assess variation in insect communities, but they are rarely integrated with information on the abundance or biomass of different taxa that can provide key insights into their functional responses. Here, we combined organismal metabarcoding and biomass estimates of different clades of aquatic insects to assess how different facets of their biodiversity (taxonomic and functional diversity; species traits) are affected by multiple stressors, including invasive species, drought and variation in vegetation. In 44 waterbodies in Northern Italy, we measured environmental features (e.g., pond surface, hydroperiod, and the presence of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and collected insect specimens. Specimens were weighed and then used for DNA metabarcoding. The relationship between biomass of seven insect orders and their relative abundance in metabarcoding data was used to obtain quantitative estimates of taxa biomasses across communities and to extract multiple diversity measures. Different facets of biodiversity showed distinct responses to the environmental stressors. The taxonomic diversity of insect communities strongly responded to aquatic vegetation, while functional diversity was more sensitive to the invasive crayfish. Total insect biomass was negatively related to fish presence, but insects with different functional traits showed specific responses to environmental features. Our results show that integrating metabarcoding data with biomass estimates can improve our understanding of community responses to multiple stressors and highlight the importance of considering multiple measures of diversity to get a comprehensive assessment of aquatic insects' responses to environmental variation."

However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In this study, we employed a data-driven approach to analyze recurrent functional connectivity patterns in resting-state fMRI data and developed a parameterized feedback inhibition model to characterize excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. The findings demonstrate that LSD enhances global brain synchrony and dynamic complexity. This enhanced synchrony likely stems from LSD\u2019s preferential stabilization of a globally synchronized yet functionally non-modular brain state - a pattern showing higher occurrence probability and acts as an \u201cattractor\u201d that recruits transitions from cognitive control networks. Crucially, these phenomena appear underpinned by LSD-induced convergence of excitatory/inhibitory balance across cortical hierarchies, particularly through Sensorimotor (SOM) suppression coupled with transmodal potentiation, where the Sensorimotor cortices emerge as potential regulatory hubs driving this neurochemical rebalancing. These convergent effects are consistent with the emergence of a brain state characterized by weakened sensory anchoring and enhanced cognitive flexibility, where the typical separation between concrete perception and abstract cognition becomes blurred. This neurophysiological remodeling therefore suggests a potential mechanism that could contribute to LSD\u2019s hallucinatory effects and its therapeutic potential in mental disorders characterized by rigid thought patterns."

Recent deep learning models have started to combine different types of cellular information, such as spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, ligand\u2013receptor signaling, and in some cases, gene regulatory networks. However, they often treat a cell\u2019s external interactions and internal gene regulation separately, merging them at the final step using simple concatenation or addition. This limits the model\u2019s ability to capture how cell\u2013cell communication and internal molecular states are connected. In this paper, we present MAGNET (Multi-view Graph Autoencoder with Cell-Gene Attention Network), a framework that reconstructs cell\u2013cell interaction networks by building multiple biological graphs and developing a Cell-Gene attention module to link a cell\u2019s environment with its internal gene activity in a unified representation. On benchmark datasets (seqFISH, MERFISH, STARMAP), MAGNET demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing cell-cell interaction networks, achieving an Average Precision(AP) of 0.901 on the seqFISH dataset and outperforming TENET by 0.185. The Cell-Gene Attention module is critical to MAGNET\u2019s performance, as its removal alone caused the AP on the seqFISH dataset to drop from 0.901 to 0.521. Applied to a breast cancer dataset, MAGNET found functional heterogeneity among cancer cells, distinguishing clusters with molecular signatures for either immune evasion or autonomous tumor growth."

In addition, we introduce a layout algorithm that aims to improve clarity by minimizing the total reticulate displacement of reticulate edges.

Kirk</p>\n\nThe subcellular localisation of proteins is a key determinant of their function. High-throughput analyses of these localisations can be performed using mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, which enables us to examine the localisation and relocalisation of proteins. Furthermore, complementary data sources can provide additional sources of functional or localisation information. Examples include protein annotations and other high-throughput \u2018omic assays. Integrating these modalities can provide new insights as well as additional confidence in results, but existing approaches for integrative analyses of spatial proteomics datasets, such as concatenation-based methods and transfer learning approaches like KNN-TL, are limited in the types of data they can integrate and do not quantify uncertainty in their predictions. Here we propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach (wherein model parameters are inferred from <i>both</i> labeled marker proteins and unlabeled data while quantifying prediction uncertainty) to integrate spatial proteomics datasets with other data sources, to improve the inference of protein sub-cellular localisation. We demonstrate our approach outperforms other transfer-learning methods and has greater flexibility in the data it can model - including categorical annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology terms), continuous measurements (e.g., protein abundance), and temporal profiles (e.g., time-series expression data). To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we apply our method to integrate spatial proteomics data generated for the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> with time-series gene expression data generated over its cell cycle. Our findings suggest that proteins linked to invasion organelles are associated with expression programs that peak at the end of the first cell-cycle. Furthermore, this integrative analysis divides the dense granule proteins into heterogeneous populations suggestive of potentially different functions. Our method is disseminated via the mdir R package available on the lead author\u2019s Github."

Einevoll</p>\n\nElectrical stimulation of nervous tissue is grounded in well-established biophysical principles, yet understanding its precise effect on neural activity remains challenging. This represents a major obstacle to both scientific and clinical applications of electrical brain stimulation.\nWe here show that the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism can be applied more broadly than previously acknowledged, providing a framework for elucidating the effects of electrical brain stimulation on neurons. Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation\u2013induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/<i>r</i> falloff for nearby and 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> falloff for distant neurons.\nWe also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.\nThe reciprocity-based approach to electrical stimulation reproduces a large body of previous experimental data, and provides new insights into how ES affects neurons."

    "content": "<p>by Nilapratim Sengupta, Jennifer I. Luebke, Christina M. Weaver</p>\n\nAction potentials (APs) propagate along axons to enable precise and rapid neuronal communication. Axon collaterals extend a given neuron\u2019s range by distributing signals to multiple targets, but also increase its electrical demands. Myelination facilitates saltatory conduction, dramatically enhancing transmission speed and ensuring conduction fidelity over long distances. The interplay between myelin dystrophy and axonal arborization remains largely unexplored, despite their role in the impairment of AP conduction in brain circuits. Here we used cohorts of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental models of rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) layer 3 pyramidal neurons to investigate how axon collateralization, myelin dystrophy, and other structural and biophysical perturbations affect AP conduction velocity (CV). We identified core diameter and branch point location, particularly its distance from the soma, as key structural determinants of CV. Under pathological conditions, branch points emerged as sites of heightened vulnerability, where even focal myelin damage markedly impaired conduction. The efficacy of remyelination to restore CV depended on the number of segments that replaced each demyelinated region. Effective length constant and focal input resistance largely predicted CV reductions caused by structural changes. In addition to demyelination, CV was highly sensitive to variations in axoplasmic and membrane resistivities, the formation of myelin balloons, and ion channel redistribution. These findings offer a mechanistic framework for understanding AP conduction in myelinated axons with complex topologies, while also pointing to potential factors underlying individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive impairments. This work thus provides an important building block for multiscale modeling of network and behavioral effects of aging, as well as axonopathies such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and traumatic brain injury."

    "content": "<p>by Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>\n\nShape perception is central to human vision, but its developmental origins remain unknown. Here we show that shape perception develops from three ingredients: (1) generic fitting systems, (2) embodied visual experiences, and (3) biologically plausible sensors. We first show that generic fitting models (transformers) trained on embodied visual experiences change from color-based to shape-based visual systems. We then perform <i>in silico</i> controlled-rearing experiments to determine what causes this developmental change. We find that view diversity\u2014experiencing many views of the same object\u2014produces shape perception. For embodied agents, view diversity comes for free: by moving through the world, agents acquire diverse temporally linked views, explaining how and why animals develop shape perception so rapidly. But when view diversity is restricted, by limiting where an agent can look or move, shape perception fails to develop. Finally, we show that retinas naturally transform images in ways that enhance shape learning, providing a biologically plausible substitute for artificial image augmentations. Together, our results support generic fitting theories of brain development and provide a template for building human-like shape perception in machines."

LCMSpector is a standalone graphical user interface application for straightforward analysis of targeted mass spectrometry data, distributed under the MIT license and available free of charge for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine by specifying the desired mass-to-charge ratios of the targeted compound ions and simply clicking \u201cProcess\u201d. It allows for the processing of multiple files simultaneously, freely modifying and exporting graphs in real time, and calculating compound concentrations based on calibration standards.

    "content": "<p>by Sol\u00e8ne Song, Paul Villoutreix</p>\n\nDevelopment is a complex process driven by coordinated cell proliferation, differentiation, and spatial organization. Classically, two ways to specify cell types during development have been hypothesized: the mosaic and regulative modes. In the mosaic mode, a particular cell isolated from the rest of the embryo will still give rise to progeny with the same fate as expected in normal development, relying on lineage-inherited factors. In contrast, in the regulative mode, the fate of a cell depends on its interactions with its environment and thus relies on space-dependent factors. While both modes often co-exist, their relative contributions remain poorly quantified at single-cell resolution. We present a novel approach to measure these contributions from single-cell data from <i>C. elegans</i> development. The invariant lineage of <i>C. elegans</i> allows the integration of spatial positions, lineage relationships, and protein expression data. Using single-cell protein expression profiles as a readout of cell state, we define two quantifiable metrics: 1) a proxy for the contribution of the mosaic mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell lineage distance and the cell-cell expression distance, 2) a proxy for the contribution of the regulative mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell context distance \u2013 capturing spatial neighborhood similarity - and the cell-cell expression distance. To validate these metrics, we compared empirical results from <i>C. elegans</i> to artificial models with defined developmental rules. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of mosaic and regulative modes, with their relative contributions varying across tissues and developmental stages. For example, in skin tissue, the mosaic mode dominates in early development, while the regulative mode prevails later. Our approach offers a quantitative, unbiased, and perturbation-free method to study fundamental principles of developmental biology."

    "content": "<p>by Sofia Radrizzani, Juan Rivas-Santisteban, Namshik Han, Laurence D. Hurst</p>\n\nDespite early assumptions of neutrality, numerous mechanisms are now thought to cause selection on synonymous mutations, commonly supported by a low evolutionary rate at synonymous sites (<i>K</i><sub>s</sub>). This has been best evidenced in the first ~10 codons of genes in <i>E. coli,</i> where <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is less than around half that of the gene body. Diverse lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these first ~10 codons are under selection for high AT content which causes low mRNA stability that in turn enables ribosomal initiation. There remains one enigmatic discrepancy, however, namely that the low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain extends far beyond the first 10 codons. Here we ask why this is. As we see no evidence that the zone influencing protein levels has been misestimated, we consider three further hypotheses: that reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is a) owing to overlapping genes, b) reflects an extended slow translational \u201cramp,\u201d and c) is mutational. We reject the first two as in both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus sp.</i> the extended low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain persists on analysis of non-overlapping genes and in <i>Bacillus</i>, where fast optimal codons tend to be A/T-ending, a fast-to-slow codon trend is seen. We fail to falsify the third hypothesis. Employing mutation accumulation data for <i>E. coli</i> we show that the 5\u2032 end has a lower mutation rate, with the first 10 codons having a rate around half that of the gene body, this then steadily increasing following the trend seen for <i>K</i><sub>s</sub>. Compositional variation is likely to explain some of the difference, the 5\u2032 end lacking GC-rich runs while these are most mutagenic. We conclude that even a highly reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is not always adequate to substantiate selection on synonymous mutations. This result has broad implications for inference of the causes of evolutionary rate variation."

    "content": "<p>by Ya-Wen Hsueh, Po-Min Chiang</p>\n\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) requires high sensitivity, throughput, and broad compatibility across specimens. Current high-capacity methods lack sensitivity compared to low-capacity counterparts. Moreover, tissue-specific methods for collecting cells/nuclei limit unbiased comparisons across samples. Here, we propose a Unified framework by Split-Pool barcoding with optimal-efficiency PolydeoxyAdenylation for scRNA detection (USPPAR). Using short and long dsDNA substrates, low Co\u00b2\u207a\u2009concentration, while eliminating all other metal-ion components, enabled terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to efficiently polydeoxyadenylate intractable blunt and 3\u2032 recessed dsDNA ends, which was unattainable with other systems. By benchmarking against six state-of-the-art technologies using HEK293, the efficient addition of PCR handles for cDNA amplification made USPPAR\u2019s gene detection sensitivity comparable to high-sensitivity methods and significantly higher than existing high-cell-capacity platforms. In primary PBMCs, USPPAR enabled high-sensitivity, high-resolution scRNA-seq, and lysine conjugation improved sensitivity as an RNase inactivator. Based on nuclease reporter and mRNA protection assays, partially chelated Cu\u00b2\u207a\u2009served as a potent, non-precipitating, broad-spectrum nuclease inhibitor across various pH levels. Beyond demonstrating high sensitivity in liver tissue, an organ with low nuclease activity, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with this inhibitor enabled one-pot extraction of RNA-stable nuclei from nuclease-rich tissues, such as the pancreas. Finally, comparisons with reference datasets from the 10\u00d7 platform using mouse spleen and maize tissues showed that USPPAR matched cell-type coverage while achieving higher gene-detection efficiency. With five key enzymes available and quality-controlled, USPPAR provides a unified, cost-effective, sensitive method for high-cell-capacity scRNA profiling of diverse specimens without special equipment."

    "content": "Memory reactivation renders consolidated memory fragile and thereby opens the window for memory updates, such as memory reconsolidation. However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory retrieval-extinction protocol prevents the return of fear expression shortly after extinction training, and this short-term effect is memory reactivation dependent (Study 1, <i>N</i>=57 adults). Furthermore, across different timescales, the memory retrieval-extinction paradigm triggers distinct types of fear amnesia in terms of cue specificity and cognitive control ability dependence, suggesting that the short-term fear amnesia might be caused by different mechanisms from the cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, <i>N</i>=79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, <i>N</i>=75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that both memory reactivation and intact prefrontal cortex function were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia after the retrieval-extinction protocol. The differences in temporal scale, cue specificity, and cognitive control ability dependence between the short- and long-term amnesia suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings suggest the potential involvement of coordinated memory modulation processes upon memory retrieval and may inform clinical approaches for treating persistent maladaptive memories."

    "content": "Forming new memories after a one-time experience requires initial encoding then consolidation over time. During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labeling 24 hr following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows us to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN\u2212 neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM\u2212 neurons. This suggests that CA3 PNs recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 PNs undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task."

Although surface biases in the Central North Atlantic are reduced, the representation of the North Atlantic Current path and strength in mesoscale-resolving models requires further improvement."

Data collected between 2022 and 2024 reveal seasonal inflow of warm, salty Atlantic water from Baffin Bay, as well as seasonal and spatial variability within cooler Polar Water. The findings establish a framework for interpreting physical variability within Disko Bay and its connection to the west Greenland coastal system."

    "content": "Collective behavior is a defining property of multicellular systems, where coordinated outcomes emerge from local cell-cell interactions. Yet the quantitative rules linking single-cell decision-making to tissue-scale organization remain poorly resolved. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that defines an order parameter predicting when initially disordered colonies undergo a transition to ordered fate alignment and when minimal, localized inputs can redirect their collective state. This analysis reveals a distinct control regime in which multicellular assemblies become susceptible to a single engineered guide cell. We validate these predictions by introducing guide cells that integrate into unperturbed colonies and redirect fate patterns within the theoretically defined control windows. Together, these results connect single-cell decision rules to emergent tissue-level organization and establish a generalizable biological control strategy in which a minority engineered subset can reliably redirect the developmental trajectory of a much larger multicellular population."

    "content": "Vector surveillance is vital for public health, yet traditional methods often face limitations. This study assessed the use of metagenomic sequencing for analyzing mosquitoes, cockroaches, flies, and rodents from Zhongshan, China. The results revealed a high concordance between metagenomic and Sanger sequencing for species identification (Kappa = 0.667, P = 0.011). Metagenomic analysis identified vector-specific dominant bacteria, including Wolbachia in mosquitoes, Blattabacterium sp. in cockroaches, Bartonella tribocorum and Leptospira interrogans in rodents, and Vagococcus teuberi in flies. It also detected numerous classical pathogens, such as Enterococcus faecalis, L. interrogans, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Among the identified fungi and viruses, 19 were human pathogens, while seven posed a threat to agriculture, notably Pepper mild mottle virus and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus. These findings systematically characterize the microbial communities associated with various vectors, highlight the potential of metagenomics for broad pathogen screening, and underscore its utility in large-scale vector surveillance and public health protection."
