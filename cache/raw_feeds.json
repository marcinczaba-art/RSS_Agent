The forest line has moved upward since the 1850s, driven by the regional abandonment of grazing and the presence of the mountain pine. Despite the recent acceleration of this shift, the closed forest line has moved upward even faster."

    "content": "Abstract\nReliable paleotemperature proxies are essential for reconstructing past climate. To refine interpretation of the MBT'5ME index, based on bacterial brGDGT lipids, a year\u2010long study was conducted in Rotsee, Switzerland, a seasonally stratified lake with a 4\u201321\u00b0C temperature range. Suspended particulate matter was collected monthly from the epilimnion and the hypolimnion, complemented by surface sediments and surrounding soils. Both intact polar (IPL) and core lipid (CL) brGDGTs were analyzed alongside 16S rRNA gene data to disentangle environmental (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH) and biological (microbial community) controls on brGDGT compositions. In the stratified epilimnion, MBT'5ME values showed a muted response to summer warming (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59, p\u00a0<\u00a00.1), whereas the isomer ratio (IR) correlated more strongly with temperature (r\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). MBT'5ME and IR were also significantly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.93, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), providing a novel diagnostic tool to identify sedimentary GDGTs derived from surface waters. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with pH (r\u00a0=\u00a00.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and IR with dissolved oxygen (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.65 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Microbial DNA analysis revealed low Acidobacterial abundances (<0.4% of reads), suggesting MBT'5ME patterns are not solely driven by this phylum. Instead, hypolimnion IPL\u2010brGDGTs correlated with gene abundance of several other bacteria, indicating broader microbial contributions. Surface sediments reflected an integrated water column signal, while also showing evidence for additional in situ IPL\u2010brGDGT production. Overall, findings demonstrate that stratification onset drives MBT'5ME variability, while epilimnion temperature exerts stronger control on IR, refining their application in paleoclimate proxies."

    "content": "Abstract\nWetlandscapes\u2014networks of hydrologically connected wetlands\u2014can influence the transport and transformation of nutrients across watersheds. As climate change and human activity reshape wetland extent and connectivity, these landscape\u2010scale processes are being altered in ways that may intensify eutrophication in downstream lakes. We used Landsat\u2010derived inundation data (1984\u20132020) to evaluate how long\u2010term changes in wetlandscape properties have affected nutrient loading and phytoplankton bloom dynamics in Lake Winnipeg, Canada. Over this period, wetlands generally increased in number and size and exhibited greater connectivity to rivers and the lake but with declines observed after \u223c2015. These changes coincided with periods of substantial increases in the magnitude and spatial extents of phytoplankton blooms followed by declines in 2015 in the North Basin. Sub\u2010watersheds with shorter runoff travel distances to the lake showed stronger relationships between wetland connectivity and bloom metrics (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.10), suggesting reduced opportunity for nutrient retention and transformation. Incorporating runoff travel distance into wetlandscape assessments improved correlations with nutrient inputs and bloom extent. Rising surface temperatures further contributed to bloom intensification. These findings highlight how climate\u2010driven changes in wetland connectivity influence lake nutrient dynamics and demonstrate the potential for globally available satellite data to support spatially targeted water quality management."

    "content": "Abstract\nRecent advancements in remote sensing imagery classification have greatly improved monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics, deepening our understanding of their effects on ecosystems and terrestrial nutrient cycling. Forecasting LULC change remains challenging because it is strongly influenced by socioeconomic drivers and biogeochemical processes linked to land management and climate change. To address this complexity, a wide range of models has been developed, from process\u2010based to statistical approaches. Yet, comparisons at regional and global scales reveal large discrepancies, underscoring the need for more consistent calibration and validation with historical observations. Here, we leverage the increasing availability of annual LULC maps to evaluate the temporal performance of two independent data\u2010driven approaches: ARIMA time\u2010series forecasting and a deterministic Lotka\u2013Volterra ecological\u2010inspired model, across the R\u00edo de la Plata Grasslands, a threatened South American ecosystem. Both methods outperformed memoryless Markov chain models in capturing annual LULC transitions without requiring time\u2010consuming processing spatial inputs. These results demonstrate that incorporating long\u2010term annual LULC histories can substantially improve predictive skill and provide a robust framework for model intercomparison, with clear implications for linking land\u2010cover change to ecosystem and Earth system modeling."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change is now a reality, one that requires and will continue to require robust scientific information to guide mitigation and adaptation policies. Although this is true for all countries worldwide, low\u2010 and middle\u2010gross domestic product countries (LMGDP) face major technical, institutional, and financial barriers to producing such knowledge. These constraints limit their ability to generate greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, define clear mitigation pathways, and design robust adaptation strategies. In contrast, freely available global scientific data are increasingly abundant. Open\u2010access resources from a wide range of institutions provide high\u2010quality climate and socioeconomic information at no cost. Leveraging these resources, combined with targeted capacity building and equitable international partnerships, offers a pathway to reduce research costs, avoid duplication, and strengthen policy\u2010relevant science in these countries. Addressing the paradox of global data abundance versus local data scarcity requires not only open data but open collaboration that integrates global expertise with local knowledge. In this commentary, two critical topics are employed to illustrate this challenge: (a) the calculation of reliable national GHG budgets essential for effective mitigation and (b) the development of adaptation pathways within nationally determined contributions. Strengthening national capacities while harnessing global data sets represents a crucial step toward enabling LMGDP countries to respond effectively to climate change."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe interannual variations of wintertime mixed layer depth (MLD) in the northern South China Sea (SCS), a region characterized by the deepest MLD within the basin and subduction process, are elucidated based on the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA, version 2.2.4) reanalysis data between 1950 and 2010. Our results reveal that the wintertime MLD possesses two predominant modes of 2\u20134\u2010year and 7\u20138\u2010year, involving different dynamical processes. Responses of thermal structure to local air\u2010sea interface factors primarily explain the 2\u20134\u2010year period MLD variability, with sea surface net heat flux playing a more crucial role than wind stress curl. Whereas for the 7\u20138\u2010year period MLD variability, Luzon Strait Transport (LST), high\u2010dense inflow from the Pacific Ocean into the northern SCS, is the dominant driver, while local air\u2010sea interface factors play a minor role. The difference between surface and subsurface layers inflow (\u0394LST ${\\Delta }\\text{LST}$), which is appropriate to represent the LST impact on vertical density gradient, can effectively modulate the upper layer stratification intensity in the northern SCS. Thus, a stronger (weaker) \u0394LST ${\\Delta }\\text{LST}$ conduces to establish a more unstable (stable) state therein, favorable to a vigorous (stagnant) vertical mixing and MLD deepening. Further analyses demonstrate the importance of both horizontal heat and salt advections related to LST in the northern SCS. That is to say, different from the 2\u20134\u2010year MLD variability, the salinity effect is of importance in driving this 7\u20138\u2010year MLD variability."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Southern Ocean plays a critical role in climate change while it remains incompletely understood due to lack of observations. This work utilizes the unique collection of temperature measurements from eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBTs) deployed along repeated transects together with the available Argo profiles across the Southern Ocean south of South Africa to examine long\u2010term temperature changes in this region. Summertime temperature sections in the upper 800\u00a0m were constructed along the XBT transect using 2,833 XBT and 1,631 Argo profiles during the period 2004\u20132020. The results show different temperature changes north and south of the Polar Front (PF): (a) north of the PF: warming from 2004/2005 to 2011/2012 and cooling from 2011/2012 to 2019/2020 in the top 300\u00a0m, which are linked to the wind field changes associated with the Southern Annual Mode, and meridional shifts of the PF and the Subantarctic Front; (b) south of the PF: consistent warming in the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) below 200\u00a0m and cooling above in the surface layer during the whole study period. The warming trend in the CDW is small but significant compared with the interannual variability. These temperature changes south of the PF might be due to the reduced vertical mixing caused by the freshening of the surface water induced by the increased sea ice melting. These findings improve understanding of observed temperature changes in the south of South Africa and provide means to establish a connection across the Southern Ocean."

    "content": "Abstract\nTidal mixing in the Kara Gates Strait (KGS) modulates transport of warm water from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea, playing a pivotal role in the transformation of Atlantic Water and the heat budget of the Arctic. Although previous studies have identified the presence of large\u2010amplitude internal waves by the interaction of M2 tidal currents with rough topography, understanding of the energetics and dynamics of M2 internal tides (ITs) in the KGS remains limited. Using a high\u2010resolution model, this study investigates the generation, propagation, and dissipation of M2 ITs. The results reveal that, in addition to the previously identified source in the central KGS, the slope of Vaygach Island serves as another major source of ITs with energy intensity exceeding that of the central strait. Background circulation confines the ITs within \u223c10\u00a0km off the slope forming atypical coastal trapped waves (CTWs). Theoretical solutions for these CTWs reveal a dominance of high vertical modes with energy dissipation exhibiting a \u201csandwich\u2010like\u201d structure. Applying the Lagrangian filtering, internal tides and lee waves along the KGS are separated. Dissipation associated with lee waves ranges from 10\u22127 to 10\u22126\u00a0W/kg comparable to those induced by ITs, yet their role in driving local mixing has been largely underestimated in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the dynamics around the KGS and their implications for Arctic tidal mixing processes."

The autonomous totivirus and its satellite can coexist but with an asymmetric dependence of the satellite on the totivirus for replication and maintenance inside the host cell. Satellites provide their yeast hosts with inhibitory toxins and the necessary self-immunity; loss of the satellite equates to loss of toxin immunity. Because these viral elements lack known extracellular stages, and sex is suspected to be rare, they are assumed to be transmitted vertically, implying that infection states should correlate with host genotypes. However, totivirus\u2013satellite coinfections are rarely examined in natural populations, leaving their associations with host genotypes poorly understood. We screened a multiyear, vineyard-associated population of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">S. cerevisiae</span> isolates from New Zealand to examine the stability of host\u2013virus associations over time, both within and across genotypes. Over half of the wild isolates harbored infections (55%), but less than half of these (37% of infected) had toxin-encoding satellites. Genotypes that persisted across years typically maintained consistent infection states. However, we also observed stepwise transitions from coinfection through infection to an infection-free state, as well as acquisition of totiviruses and satellites. Genotypes clustered strongly by infection state, and population heterozygosity was significantly lower than expected, supporting vertical transmission while suggesting that outcrossing is not responsible for the acquisition of higher infection states. Despite occasional intragenotypic transitions, genotype clustering by infection state remained intact, suggesting that such transitions are transient and that host genotypes may have optimal infection states with regard to totiviruses and their satellites.</span>"

Despite their ecological and cultural significance, crocodilians are a taxon that remains underexplored in microbiome research. We investigated cloacal bacteriome samples from both wild and captive populations to identify compositional and functional differences resulting from captivity. Our findings reveal significant alterations in bacterial diversity and community structure in captive crocodiles, with notable shifts at both phylum and family levels; specifically, Bacteroidota and Fusobacteriota dominate in captivity, whereas wild crocodiles exhibit a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota and Bacillota. The Shannon diversity index indicates a significant reduction in bacterial diversity among captive individuals, likely due to husbandry practices that foster a microbially depauperate environment. Additionally, serum metabolomics analysis shows an enrichment of alcohol sugars in captive crocodiles, alongside a decrease in pantothenic acid. While this is the first study to characterize these traits in saltwater crocodiles, further research is necessary to determine the physiological consequences of these bacterial and metabolic changes on host fitness and adaptability. Longitudinal studies are essential for understanding how bacterial communities evolve over time and in response to environmental factors, which will inform conservation strategies and improve the management of captive populations of crocodilians intended for reintroduction into the wild.</span>"

For Arctic lakes, increasing meltwater and precipitation may enhance the inputs of nutrients, organic matter and microorganisms from their catchments, and the increasingly ice-free, open-water conditions of the Arctic Ocean may favor increased inputs of marine aerosols, including microbiota. This study therefore aimed to determine how changing connectivity to terrestrial and marine habitats may affect the dispersal, sorting, and establishment of bacterial communities in a coastal High Arctic lake. Three habitats in this model system were sampled for ice, water, and snow: the lake, inflowing water tracks over permafrost soils, and an adjacent ice-dammed bay connected to the Arctic Ocean. Lake water chemistry confirmed the hydrological connection between the lake and terrestrial habitats, with the lake fed by terrestrial carbon sources via snow and groundwater run-off. Sequencing of 16S rDNA and rRNA showed evidence of a small marine and terrestrial influence on the lake, but few bacterial phylotypes were common to all three connected habitats. These results imply ongoing strong environmental filtering by habitat type, despite the apparent and potentially rising connectivity, and provide an example of bacterial resilience in a region of rapid climate change.</span>"

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nWe studied the drivers of population\u2010genetic structuring and genetic diversity in specialist parasites based on whole\u2010genome resequencing data from 82 Echinophthirius horridus seal louse individuals sampled from 12 ecologically and behaviourally different phocine seal species, subspecies and populations across the Holarctic. We found that the main genetic disjunctions in E. horridus lice occur across seal host species and subspecies, with a further level of population subdivision emerging among host individuals within some populations. Endemic and relict landlocked seal (sub)species host the genetically most distinct louse populations, while lice associated with sympatric marine seals show signatures of occasional gene flow across hosts. Within the latter, the most extreme case is seen in the near\u2010panmictic lice associated with northern European grey and harbour seals, which aggregate in shared rookeries and colonies. Although the louse and seal phylogenies were overall statistically significantly congruent, evidence for similar host shifts in the past is reflected in several conflicts in the phylogenetic trees of the lice and their hosts. Population\u2010level mean heterozygosity and theta in seal lice varied considerably, and both measures of genetic variation were statistically significantly related to host population size. Taken together, our results support a non\u2010adaptive model of parasite diversification, in which geographic and behavioural isolation among hosts drives parasite genetic differentiation, and genetic erosion in bottlenecked hosts cascades up to their specialist parasites. Our results provide new insights into processes that generate parasite diversity and trigger parallel losses of genetic diversity in endangered host\u2013parasite systems."

We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical <i>slow-fast dissection</i> method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations."

In contexts of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This paper presents extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary processes (such as birth) of the model directly from the data. We additionally incorporate a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process hyperparameters to the data.\nSeveral test cases are considered, demonstrating the method\u2019s performance for several standard models from population modeling, including age and size-structured models.

Here, we identify that BRCA1 protein stability is controlled through ubiquitin lysine 11 (K11)-linkage modification under the regulation of Cezanne deubiquitinating enzyme, APC/C E3 ligase, and Ube2S E2 conjugating enzyme in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cezanne-deficiency leads to increased BRCA1 K11-ubiquitination, decreased BRCA1 protein level, and increased cellular sensitivity to PARPi. The BRCA1 K11-linked ubiquitination is carried out through a degron on BRCA1 that is recognized by APC/C cofactor Cdh1. Tumor expression and mutational analyses indicate that Cezanne low or Ube2S high expression is associated with \u201cBRCAness\u201d and correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, our study has demonstrated a ubiquitin K11-linked ubiquitination pathway that regulates BRCA1 protein stability, dysregulation of which predicts BRCA1-deficiency that may be effectively targeted with PARPi therapy."

Here, we studied how food supply and TOR signaling regulate the cell cycle in a multipotent population of Vasa2-/Piwi1-expressing cells in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>. We discovered that starvation induces a reversible G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle arrest in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells and that cell cycle re-entry upon refeeding is dependent on TOR signaling. In addition, the length of the refeeding stimulus after starvation determines the proportion of cells that re-enter S-phase. Remarkably, prolonged starvation delayed both refeeding-induced TOR signaling activation and S-phase re-entry, and led to a global decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells. This strongly suggests that <i>Nematostella</i> Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells undergo starvation-controlled quiescence deepening, a phenomenon previously described only in unicellular eukaryotes and mammalian cell culture. The nutritional control of quiescence and cell proliferation may thus be a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved strategy underlying the environmental regulation of indeterminate growth in animals."

Here, we used Sf9 cells to express HCAR3-Gi and HCAR2-Gi complexes, and present cryo-EM structures of HCAR3-Gi complexes with agonists compound 6O (3.31 \u00c5), D-phenyllactic acid (3.05 \u00c5), IBC293 (3.26 \u00c5), and acifran (3.18\u00c5), as well as HCAR2-Gi complex with agonist acifran (2.72 \u00c5). Our findings reveal the mechanism behind 6O\u2019s highest affinity to HCAR3, attributed to its full occupation of both R1 and R2 regions of the orthosteric binding pocket. Moreover, combined with cAMP assay in HEK-293 cells, we have elucidated that the ligand selectivity between HCAR3 and HCAR2 depended on <i>\u03c0</i>\u2013<i>\u03c0</i> interaction with F107<sup>3.32</sup> (L107<sup>3.32</sup> in HCAR2) and ligand-binding pocket size difference, facilitated by key residues difference V/L83<sup>2.60</sup>, Y/N86<sup>2.63</sup>, and S/W91<sup>23.48</sup>. Collectively, these structural insights lay the groundwork for developing HCAR3-specific drugs, potentially avoiding HCAR2-induced adverse effects."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/104242",
    "content": "Sensory information is represented by small varying neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. In the auditory cortex (AC), repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles, indicating high trial-by-trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation in awake mice to study how increased activity of single cells affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched their tuning property, while non-co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non-co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results show that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent."

    "content": "Abstract\nDeep long\u2010period (DLP) earthquakes have been observed at many volcanic settings around the world and linked to the magmatic processes that drive volcanic unrest. At the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC) of the Cascade arc, limited detection of DLP activity hinders classification of anomalous seismic behavior and its relationship to the LVC magmatic system. This study uses a template matching approach with seismic data from temporary nodal and permanent stations to detect and locate DLP earthquakes near the LVC between 2017 and 2024. Within the DLP catalog of 611 events, a transition occurs from scattered (2017\u20132020) to oscillatory (2021\u20132024) occurrence rates. During the oscillatory period, regional earthquakes with large amplitude velocity waveforms observed near the LVC are associated with abrupt changes in DLP occurrence rates. Continued monitoring of DLP activity has the potential to better define the processes that drive volcanic unrest at the LVC in the future."

    "content": "Abstract\nUncorrected long\u2010wavelength contributions remain a major limitation for interpreting InSAR time\u2010series over large areas (>100\u00a0km). Among them, the ionosphere can impact InSAR measurements across various timescales, potentially biasing secular velocity estimates. We use Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) to predict ionospheric effects for >15,000 Sentinel\u20101 acquisitions in France, Tibet, and Central Andes. We evaluate GIM\u2010based corrections using phase ramps (planar functions fitted to interferograms) as proxies for long\u2010wavelength signals, enabling analysis of their temporal evolution. After correcting for solid Earth tides and oceanic tidal loading, GIM\u2010derived predictions show a strong temporal consistency with observed ramps, effectively capturing seasonal and multi\u2010year fluctuations with amplitudes of \u223c ${\\sim} $0.2\u00a0mm/km. The highest\u2010resolution GIM also corrects part of the strong daily fluctuations of along\u2010track ramps observed on ascending tracks over equatorial regions. These corrections reduce ramp rate uncertainty and improve agreement with GNSS, paving the way toward direct InSAR measurement of tectonic plate motion."

Using the combined COSMIC\u2010Arase data set, we provide a convenient way to reconcile the two regions in empirical models based on the analytical Chapman function inversion for scale height.

However, the geomagnetic reversal pattern during the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition remains elusive. Here we present an integrated magneto\u2010 and cyclo\u2010stratigraphic study of a \u223c1.8\u2010Myr\u2010long, late Ediacaran succession in Newfoundland, Canada. We obtained a reversal frequency of 10\u201312\u00a0Myr\u22121, documenting a hyperactively reversing geodynamo during the late Ediacaran. Together with the updated reversal records and paleointensity data sets, we propose a >70\u2010Myr\u2010long interval of geomagnetic reversal hyperactivity before the Ordovician Reversed Superchron, forming a hyperactivity\u2010superchron couplet that recurs in the mid\u2010Paleozoic and Mesozoic.

    "content": "Abstract\nReservoirs provide key water storage in regions facing projected water scarcity and population growth. Many reservoirs experience water level fluctuations including periods of drawdown tied to drought. To examine sensitivity of water clarity to drawdown, we compiled 30\u00a0years of water level and Secchi depth measurements in southern Great Plains reservoirs (n\u00a0=\u00a084) positioned across a climate gradient from the arid west to the wetter east. Mixed\u2010effect models incorporated reservoir\u2010specific coefficients relating Secchi depth to water storage volume. Predictions from the best model indicated that many reservoirs lost more than half of their Secchi depth as water levels approached their recorded lows. Reservoirs in west and central Texas tended to experience more severe drawdown and more pronounced loss of water clarity during drawdown. These results show that droughts can cause a dual setback in which the loss of water quantity coincides with loss of water quality in reservoirs."

We present petrological and geochemical analyses of six very\u2010low\u2010Ti (VLT) basalt fragments from Chang'e\u20106 (CE6) samples. These basalts yield a Pb\u2010Pb age of around 2.9\u00a0Ga, representing the youngest reported VLT volcanism. They are slightly older than the low\u2010Ti basalts from the same soils and exhibit distinct pyroxene compositions and 238U/204Pb ratios, indicating derivation from distinct mantle sources. Compared to Apollo and Luna VLT basalts, these samples share similarly depleted Sr\u2010Pb isotopes but display elevated rare earth element concentrations and TiO2 contents. These basalts most likely derived from low\u2010degree melting of an olivine\u2010orthopyroxene source followed by 30%\u201340% fractional crystallization. Further diffusion chronometry reveals rapid magma ascent from magma chamber to surface, likely facilitated by the thin lunar crust resulting from the South Pole\u2010Aitken basin\u2010forming impact.

Based on radar interferometry over a large field\u2010of\u2010view, the BSL was revealed to occur over a limited area northeastward of the radar and did not cause scintillation when Global Navigation Satellite System satellites passed through. The BSL vertical displacement precisely followed the F\u2010layer bottom fluctuation, without obvious horizontal movement. Interestingly, the localized BSL caused weak spread\u2010F traces in the ionograms indicating irregularities from specific directions, which are distinct from the satellite traces or range spread F related to plasma bubble development thus could serve as a new signature of BSL in future studies."

    "content": "Mammalian liver metabolism undergoes a substantial shift during fasting. Thermodynamic principles impose fundamental constraints on metabolism, and the Gibbs free energy change of reaction ({Delta}_r G) indicates the reaction direction and distance from equilibrium. However, {Delta}_r G landscapes in intact mammalian organs remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we mapped {Delta}_r G^' profile of glucose metabolism in mouse liver during fasting, using experimentally measured absolute metabolite concentrations and a newly developed computational method, GLEAM. We found that despite large metabolite fluctuations during fasting, the corresponding {Delta}_r Gs remained robust, even for reactions reversing the direction between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. A remarkable thermodynamic robustness is found in maintaining potential candidates of rate-limiting steps during fasting. This robustness is achieved by expending substantial costs for enzyme expressions, contributing to efficient switching from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, obese mouse liver also showed thermodynamic robustness despite obesity-induced metabolic disruption. Our framework provided a novel thermodynamic perspective on intact organ metabolism, demonstrating that the liver robustly maintains thermodynamic characteristics favorable for metabolic control by buffering metabolite concentration differences."

    "content": "Organisation and dynamics of chromatin play a key role in regulation of cell state and function. In cancer, chromatin plasticity is known to be important in control of drug resistance, but the relationship between chromatin compaction and chemotherapy response within complex tissue settings remains unclear. Here, we measured single nuclei chromatin compaction using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in situ in whole biopsies from 53 pre treatment and 14 post surgery tissue samples of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients to determine whether single nuclei spatial chromatin compaction state can predict resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Bulk chromatin compaction across 53 pre-treatment core biopsies did not predict patient outcome. However, machine learning analysis revealed that a subset of patients exhibited distinct distributions of single nuclei with more open chromatin states, which was predictive of NACT-resistance. Graph neural network analysis established that the spatial arrangement of chromatin compaction contributed to prediction of NACT resistance and that chromatin compaction signatures were preserved in tissue state transitions from pre- to 14 post-NACT samples. Our findings shed new light on spatial control of chromatin structure and relationship to therapeutic resistance and establish a foundation for further molecular analysis of chromatin states in complex biological tissues."

    "content": "Background: Alterations in amine metabolism have been implicated Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma are key biofluids in AD research. CSF is considered to better reflect brain metabolic alterations than plasma, while plasma can be obtained more easily. However, plasma-CSF relationships are unclear. Aim: To investigate longitudinal changes of amines in plasma and CSF, and their correlation across the two, in male and female TgF344 AD transgenic versus wildtype (WT) rats. Method: LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics was used to analyze 60 and 55 amines in plasma and CSF, respectively, of male and female TgF344-AD and WT rats, at 12, 25, 50 and 85 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized logistic regressions, Pearson correlations, and differential correlations between groups and matrixes. Results: Compared to WT controls, at 12 weeks, TgF344-AD rats showed an increase of 3-methylhistidine, anserine, cysteine, s-methylcysteine, while at 25 weeks, male TgF344-AD rats showed pronounced increases in CSF levels of alpha-aminobutyric acid, asparagine, glycylglycine, glycylproline, histidine, isoleucine, kynurenine, leucine, methionine, methionine sulfone, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine, and valine. At 50 weeks, female TgF344-AD rats exhibited reductions in CSF for DL-3-aminoisobutyric acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, and putrescine. Distinct plasma-CSF correlations were found for 1-methylhistidine, 2-aminoadipic acid, putrescine, kynurenine, N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-lysine, DL-3-aminoisobutyric acid, and taurine, particularly in TgF344-AD rats. Conclusions: Body fluid, age- and sex-dependent amine alterations in CSF and plasma of TgF344-AD rats compared to WT controls provide important insights into AD disease processes and may aid early diagnosis and therapeutic targeting."

    "content": "The CRISPR-dCas9 system has emerged as a versatile platform for programmable gene regulation, offering unique advantages in modularity and orthogonality for constructing synthetic genetic circuits. Here, we present a novel architecture for biomolecular neural networks based on dCas9, guide RNAs, and antisense RNA sequestration. Through mathematical modeling and steady-state analysis, we demonstrate that this system functions as a molecular perceptron with a threshold activation function analogous to a saturated rectified linear unit (ReLU). However, a critical challenge in scaling these circuits is competition for the finite dCas9 pool, whose expression must remain low to avoid cytotoxicity. We address this constraint by developing a resource-aware design framework and characterizing how shared dCas9 availability affects network performance. Our results show that for classification tasks, decision boundaries remain invariant under resource competition, while for regression tasks, node thresholds are preserved despite sensitivity in output magnitude under heterogeneous binding conditions. We demonstrate the computational capabilities of this platform through both linear and nonlinear classification problems, as well the approximation of a band-pass function as a proof-of-concept regression task. This work expands the repertoire of molecular mechanisms capable of computation and establishes design principles for implementing CRISPR-based neuromorphic circuits that can execute complex computational tasks within the biochemical constraints of living cells."

    "content": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as key signaling intermediates in plant metabolism, defense, and stress adaptation. In photosynthetic organisms, chloroplast and mitochondria serve as the major hubs of ROS production, thereby coordinating stress responses across cellular compartments. However, the extent of cross-organellar communication following compartmentalized oxidative stress remains poorly understood. Using C. reinhardtii as a model system, we induced compartmentalized oxidative stress in chloroplast and mitochondria to investigate whether the ROS generation in one organelle triggers any functional response in the other organelle. Methyl viologen (MV) was used to induce ROS production in the chloroplast, while menadione (MD) was used to trigger mitochondrial ROS production. Real-time monitoring of compartment-specific roGFP strains showed specific, localized, and reversible ROS production following MV and MD treatment as a function of time within the respective target organelles. Comprehensive functional analyses following compartmentalized ROS perturbations revealed that the mitochondrial ROS remained localized to their site of origin and did not detectably affect chloroplast function, as evidenced by the unchanged chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and photosystem stoichiometry. In contrast, chloroplast-derived ROS diffused from its site of origin and transiently suppressed the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Together, these findings underscore a dynamically regulated system, where chloroplast ROS leaks out and affects mitochondrial function while the mitochondrial ROS remains localized and does not impact chloroplast function. These compartment-specific ROS responses likely represent an adaptive mechanism for coordinating cellular energy metabolism in response to fluctuating environmental conditions."

    "content": "Members of the class Ktedonobacteria (phylum Chloroflexota) are widespread across a variety of terrestrial environments. They are particularly enriched in silica-rich oligotrophic caves, where they may act as early colonizers, but the genomic bases supporting this pioneering capacity are still unclear. Here, we present a systematic genomic analysis of Ktedonobacteria from diverse ecosystems, with a focus on oligotrophic caves. Cave Ktedonobacteria belong to novel genera of Ktedonobacteraceae and harbor genes supporting a mixotrophic metabolism that combines the use of organic and inorganic substrates as energy and carbon sources. Comparative analyses of all available Ktedonobacteria genomes from diverse environments showed that most metabolic traits, including those enabling atmospheric gas oxidation, are primarily driven by taxonomy. In contrast, genes involved in CO2; fixation are enriched in Ktedonobacteria inhabiting caves. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the RuBisCO of Ktedonobacteria likely represents a novel Form I subtype, which we designate as BAK, reflecting its wide occurrence in thermophilic and acidophilic Bacillota and Actinomycetota inhabiting similar extreme environments. The presence of this subtype across distinct lineages in comparable habitats suggests that it may confer a selective advantage in nutrient-poor settings (like caves) and that its distribution may be subject to horizontal gene transfer. This autotrophic capacity relies on a transaldolase variant of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle that was previously described only in one Firmicutes species. Overall, this study provides genetic evidence supporting the combination of atmospheric gas oxidation with dark CO2; fixation in Ktedonobacteria, highlighting their role as primary producers in oligotrophic ecosystems, including caves."

Within the harbor, five distinct sedimentary facies were identified, each displaying unique sediment characteristics and patterns of organic carbon burial. Mud\u2010rich, low\u2010energy facies, including rippled and bioturbated muds, consistently showed higher organic carbon density and burial rates compared to sandy, more dynamic facies. Estimated carbon stocks in the upper meter of sediment range from 44 to 120\u00a0t\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121, comparable to or exceeding those of many vegetated coastal habitats. Temporal changes in facies distribution driven by estuarine processes and variations in sediment supply led to significant long\u2010term fluctuations in organic carbon burial.

FLUXNET is a global network of regional eddy covariance networks that measure ecosystem\u2010scale exchanges of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, H2O) and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere. MexFlux is the eddy covariance network of Mexico, a megadiverse country with many underrepresented ecosystems within FLUXNET. This study evaluates the spatial representativeness of MexFlux by assessing its ability to capture the statistical and spatial heterogeneity of annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) within Mexico. We tested four network configurations: the historical distribution of MexFlux sites (MexFlux\u2010H, n\u00a0=\u00a033), an expanded network with 20 additional sites (MexFlux\u00a0+\u00a020, 53 sites), MexFlux sites with publicly available data (MexFlux\u2010P, n\u00a0=\u00a020), and a hypothetical optimized design with only 25 sites (MexFlux25, n\u00a0=\u00a025). Results show that MexFlux\u2010H and MexFlux\u2010P overrepresent regions with GPP values between 250 and 600 gC m\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121 and ET of 200\u20131,200\u00a0mm\u00a0yr\u22121. MexFlux\u00a0+\u00a020 demonstrates that adding 20 strategically located sites improves the representativeness of MexFlux while preserving the historical distribution of the network. The configuration of MexFlux25 highlights that a few but strategically distributed sites are an alternative way to enhance the representativeness of the network. Mountain regions, tropical forests, and urban sites may remain underrepresented in any network configuration, highlighting the challenges of monitoring efforts in this country. Our framework integrates distributions, copulas, semivariograms, and upscaling to highlight the value of a multidimensional assessment of spatial representativeness, which applies to other regional FLUXNET networks."

    "content": "Abstract\nNitrate discharge via stream water is a key indicator of how disturbances influence forest nutrient cycling. In a temperate forest in central Japan, 35\u00a0years of hydrological, biogeochemical, and plant uptake monitoring revealed sustained nitrate leaching for over 25\u00a0years following red pine dieback due to pine wilt disease in 1989\u20131990. Stream nitrate concentrations followed three distinct phases: (I) a rapid rise and decline (1990\u20132000), (II) a gradual decrease (2000\u20132010), and (III) a slight increase stabilizing above pre\u2010dieback levels (post\u20102010). Phase I was driven by changes in soil nitrate production following pine mortality. In Phase II, prolonged low rainfall accelerated declines in NO3\u2212 concentrations. During Phase III, natural mortality of stressed cypress trees (2008\u20132015) coincided with a decline in nitrogen uptake of up to 65.7\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121, likely contributing to renewed nitrate leaching. Field experiments demonstrated that plant growth conditions strongly influenced catchment\u2010scale nitrogen dynamics. Shifts in soil microbial activity were associated with climate variability and changes in vegetation. Notably, the effects of plant mortality on nitrate leaching were delayed, with several years separating disturbance events and hydrological responses. These findings highlight the importance of long\u2010term monitoring to capture delayed and complex responses of nutrient cycling to ecosystem disturbances, integrating approaches such as dual isotope analyses, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and vegetation uptake."

    "content": "Abstract\nOcean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a marine carbon dioxide (CO2) removal strategy that relies on lowering the ocean's pCO2 via the addition of alkaline materials to facilitate enhanced CO2 uptake with the potential for durable, long\u2010term, storage. This strategy has gained recent scientific and private sector attention as a possible component of climate mitigation portfolios, yet many research questions remain. This work describes an analysis of historical reconstructions of regional carbonate chemistry developed via application of machine learning algorithms to an ocean reanalysis product. Model skill assessment demonstrated excellent performance when compared to regional observations, and this work focuses on four carbonate system variables that may influence OAE applications: total scale pH, calcite saturation state, the theoretical molar change in dissolved inorganic carbon associated with a molar change in total alkalinity (\u0394DIC/\u0394TA), and the timescale of CO2 equilibrium of the surface mixed layer (\u03c4CO2 ${\\tau }_{{\\text{CO}}_{2}}$). These metrics were combined into a suitability index to quantify locations and times of year more favorable for OAE. Much of the US Northeast Shelf and Slope region has seasonally similar suitability for small\u2010scale OAE applications, with nearshore environments exhibiting high suitability year\u2010round. Lagrangian particle tracking experiments show strong reductions in \u0394DIC/\u0394TA and increases in \u03c4CO2 ${\\tau }_{{\\text{CO}}_{2}}$ due to horizontal and vertical transport, suggesting that when water motion is accounted for, reduced efficiency and longer equilibration times may impact successful observations of carbon uptake and storage. This analysis and framework were developed with publicly available tools, data sets, and global data products allowing for global scalability and application."

    "content": "Abstract\nStress\u2013strain relationships are fundamental to understanding deformation mechanics in any material. In sea ice, stress\u2013strain relationships are typically observed by measuring the strain resulting from known stress in samples wholly or partially isolated from the surrounding ice. Such observations show sea ice behaves elastically at short timescales, and the effective parameters describing this elastic behavior vary with temperature, salinity, and strain rate. However, these experiments often employ larger strain rates than are typical for intact, in situ ice, are labor intensive, and are typically limited to meter scale. Here we utilize a novel synthesis of existing observation techniques to quantify the effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of a km\u2010scale area of heterogeneous, drifting sea ice surrounding the Sea Ice Dynamics Experiment (SIDEx) drifting ice camp in the Beaufort Sea. In\u2010ice point measurements of two\u2010dimensional horizontal stress from an array of 31 vibrating wire stress gauges (VWSG), distributed over a \u223c1.5\u00a0km radius area, allow us to observe natural forcing conditions. A ground\u2010based interferometric radar provides contemporaneous one\u2010dimensional surface strain measurements collocated with stress within 22.5\u00a0m resolution cells. We find an effective elastic modulus of 2.4\u00a0\u00b1 $\\mathit{\\pm }$\u00a00.6\u00a0GPa and effective Poisson's ratio of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1 $\\mathit{\\pm }$\u00a00.2 describe the heterogeneous, mixed multi\u2010 and first\u2010year ice within the area of the VWSG array. These values are broadly consistent with prior laboratory and field experiments while offering a novel point of reference for real\u2010world sea ice deformation behavior under natural conditions."

However, the bioinformatic analyses and interpretation of population genomic datasets can be daunting and difficult to convey to nonspecialists, including on\u2010the\u2010ground conservationists that work with many state, federal and international agencies. We think that individual population genomic metrics of interest can be interpolated and ultimately distilled into thematic GIS layers that represent spatiotemporal genomic potential (or conversely, susceptibility) in conservation monitoring. As examples relevant to ongoing conservation efforts, we use introgressive hybridisation and individual heterozygosity to illustrate a conceptual approach for mapping population genomic susceptibility. The general framework of thematic layers could be extended to integrate key genomic metrics (e.g., runs of homozygosity and genomic load) that are relevant to many conservation efforts."

In ecology and evolutionary biology, findings, funding and research effort are disproportionately concentrated at high latitudes, while biological diversity is concentrated at low latitudes. This discrepancy may have a particular influence in fields like phylogeography, molecular ecology and conservation genetics, where the rise of genomics has increased the cost and technical expertise required to apply state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods. Here, we ask whether a fundamental biogeographic pattern\u2014the latitudinal gradient of species richness in tetrapods\u2014is reflected in the available reference genomes, an important data resource for various applications of molecular tools for biodiversity research and conservation. We also ask whether sequencing approaches differ between the Global South and Global North, reviewing the last 5\u2009years of conservation genetics research in four leading journals. We find that extant reference genomes are scarce relative to species richness at low latitudes and that reduced representation and whole\u2010genome sequencing are disproportionately applied to taxa in the Global North. We conclude with recommendations to close this gap and improve international collaborations in biodiversity genomics."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe black abalone, Haliotis cracherodii, is a large, long\u2010lived marine mollusc that inhabits rocky intertidal habitats along the coast of California and Mexico. In 1985, populations were impacted by a bacterial disease known as withering syndrome (WS) that wiped out >90% of individuals, leading to the closure of all U.S. black abalone fisheries since 1993. Current conservation strategies include restoring diminished populations by translocating healthy individuals. However, population collapse on this scale may have dramatically lowered genetic diversity and strengthened geographic differentiation, making translocation\u2010based recovery contentious. Additionally, the current prevalence of WS remains unknown. To address these uncertainties, we sequenced and analysed the genomes of 133 black abalone individuals from across their present range. We observed no spatial genetic structure among black abalone, with the exception of a single chromosomal inversion that increases in frequency with latitude. Outside the inversion, genetic differentiation between sites is minimal and does not scale with either geographic distance or environmental dissimilarity. Genetic diversity appears uniformly high across the range. Demographic inference does indicate a severe population bottleneck beginning just 15 generations in the past, but this decline is short lived, with present\u2010day size far exceeding the pre\u2010bottleneck status quo. Finally, we find the bacterial agent of WS is equally present across the sampled range, but only in 10% of individuals. The lack of population genetic structure, uniform diversity and prevalence of WS bacteria indicates that translocation could be a valid and low\u2010risk means of population restoration for black abalone species' recovery."

    "content": "Abstract\nPopulation genomics analysis holds great potential for informing conservation of endangered populations. We focused on a controversial case of European whitefish (Coregonus spp.) populations. The endangered North Sea houting is the only coregonid fish that tolerates oceanic salinities and was previously considered a species (C. oxyrhinchus) distinct from European lake whitefish (C. lavaretus). However, no firm evidence for genetic\u2010based salinity adaptation has been available. Also, studies based on microsatellite and mitogenome data suggested surprisingly recent divergence (c. 2500\u2009years bp) between houting and lake whitefish. These data types furthermore have provided no evidence for possible inbreeding. Finally, a controversial taxonomic revision recently classified all whitefish in the region as C. maraena, calling conservation priorities of houting into question. We used whole\u2010genome and ddRAD sequencing to analyse six lake whitefish populations and the only extant indigenous houting population. Demographic inference indicated post\u2010glacial expansion and divergence between lake whitefish and houting occurring not long after the Last Glaciation, implying deeper population histories than previous analyses. Runs of homozygosity analysis suggested not only high inbreeding (FROH up to 30.6%) in some freshwater populations but also FROH up to 10.6% in the houting prompting conservation concerns. Finally, outlier scans provided evidence for adaptation to high salinities in the houting. Applying a framework for defining conservation units based on current and historical reproductive isolation and adaptive divergence led us to recommend that the houting be treated as a separate conservation unit regardless of species status. In total, the results underscore the potential of genomics to inform conservation practices, in this case clarifying conservation units and highlighting populations of concern."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nArtificial propagation and wild release may influence the genetic integrity of wild populations. This practice has been prevalent in fisheries for centuries and is often termed \u2018stocking\u2019. In the Laurentian Great Lakes (Great Lakes here\u2010on), walleye populations faced declines from the 1950s to the 1970s, prompting extensive stocking efforts for restoration. By the mid\u20102010s, walleye populations showed signs of recovery, but the genetic legacy of stocking on population structure at the genomic level remains unclear. Using a dataset of 45,600 genome\u2010aligned SNP loci genotyped in 1075 walleye individuals, we investigated the genetic impacts of over 50\u2009years of stocking across the Great Lakes. Population structure was associated with both natural geographic barriers and stocking from non\u2010native sources. Admixture between Lake Erie walleye and walleye from the re\u2010populated Tittabawassee River indicate that stocking may have re\u2010distributed putatively adaptive alleles around the Great Lakes. Genome scans identified FST outliers and evidence of selective sweeps, indicating local adaptation of spawning populations is likely. Notably, one genomic region showed strong differentiation between Muskegon River and walleye from the Tittabawassee River, which was re\u2010populated by Muskegon strain walleye, suggesting admixture and selection both impact the observed genetic diversity. Overall, our study underscores how artificial propagation and translocations can significantly alter the evolutionary trajectory of populations. The findings highlight the complex interplay between stocking practices and population genetic diversity, emphasising the need for careful management strategies to preserve the genetic integrity of wild populations amidst conservation efforts."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe recently extirpated Zanzibar leopard was the only known African leopard (Panthera pardus spp.) population restricted exclusively to a major island habitat. Although its demise was driven through habitat change and conflict with humans, given its role as a keystone species for the Zanzibar Archipelago, its successful potential reintroduction might offer a means for helping preserve the natural biodiversity of its former habitat. Whether this is feasible, however, would be contingent on both whether closely related source populations can be identified on mainland Africa, and whether the Zanzibar form exhibited any special adaptations that might need to be considered when choosing such a source. In light of these questions, we genomically profiled two of the six known historic specimens, to explore whether they represent a realistic candidate for de\u2010extirpation through reintroduction. Our analyses indicate that despite its geographical separation, the Zanzibar leopard shared a close genetic relationship with mainland East African individuals. Furthermore, although its uniqueness as an island population was emphasised by genomic signatures of high inbreeding and increased mutation load, the latter similar to the level of the critically endangered Amur leopard (P. p. orientalis), we find no evidence of functionally significant genetic diversity unique to Zanzibar. We therefore conclude that should attempts to restore leopards to Zanzibar be considered, then mainland East African leopards would provide a suitable gene pool."

Consequently, there has been a surge in European restoration efforts, many of which focus on restocking as a conservation measure. In this study, we used whole\u2010genome sequencing (WGS) data to investigate the population structure, demographic history, and patterns of local adaptation of O. edulis across its natural distribution with increased sampling densities at Scandinavian localities. Results revealed seven distinct genetic clusters, including previously undescribed complex population structure in Norway, and evidence for introgression between genetic clusters in Scandinavia. We detected large structural variants (SVs) on three pseudo\u2010chromosomes. These megabase long regions were characterised by strong linkage disequilibrium and clear geographical differentiation, suggestive of chromosomal inversions potentially associated with local adaptation. The results indicated that genomic traces of past translocations of non\u2010native O. edulis were still present in some individuals, but overall, we found limited evidence of major impacts of translocations on the scale of contemporary population structure. Our findings highlight the importance of considering population structure and signatures of selection in the design of effective conservation strategies to preserve and restore wild native European flat oyster populations, and we provide direct knowledge safeguarding sustainable mitigation actions in this important species."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nSpecies with extremely small population sizes are critically endangered because of reduced genetic diversity, increased inbreeding and hybridisation threats. Genomic tools significantly advance conservation by revealing genetic insights into endangered species, notably in monitoring frameworks. Sicilian fir (Abies nebrodensis) is the most endangered conifer in Europe with only 30 adult trees in an 84\u2010ha area. Using 20,824 SNPs from RAD\u2010seq, employing genome assembly and a custom 120 SNP\u2010array, we evaluated genetic diversity, mating patterns, and effective population size in adult trees, 118 natural seedlings, and 2064 nursery seedlings from past conservation actions. We assessed introgression from neighbouring non\u2010native fir plantations (~6%) and established an intra\u2010population assisted gene flow (AGF) program selecting the most genetically dissimilar individuals and investigating the outcome through simulations. Genomic analysis unveiled significant genetic diversity among adult Sicilian firs, comparable to non\u2010endangered Mediterranean firs with larger populations. However, the genetic diversity of the forthcoming generation declined due to high self\u2010fertilisation, leading to marked inbreeding (FIS\u2009=\u20090.38) and an alarmingly low effective population size (Ne\u2009=\u20096). Nursery seedling monitoring revealed similar selfing rates and introgression (~2%) from non\u2010native firs. Although intra\u2010population AGF could help to mitigate genetic loss, it may not alleviate the species vulnerability to imminent environmental challenges, perpetuating the risk of an extinction vortex. Hence, investigating the impact of Sicilian fir population decline and selfing on inbreeding depression, along with exploring the potential of hybrids for genetic load alleviation and future adaptation, is crucial for effective conservation strategies."

    "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.17604?af=R",
    "content": "ABSTRACT\nWeedy rice is a close relative of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) that infests rice fields worldwide and drastically reduces yields. To combat this agricultural pest, rice farmers in the southern US began to grow herbicide\u2010resistant (HR) rice cultivars in the early 2000s, which permitted the application of herbicides that selectively targeted weedy rice without harming the crop. The widespread adoption of HR rice coincided with increased reliance on hybrid rice cultivars in place of traditional inbred varieties. Although both cultivated and weedy rice are predominantly self\u2010fertilising, the combined introductions of HR and hybrid rice dramatically altered the opportunities and selective pressure for crop\u2010weed hybridization and adaptive introgression. In this study, we generated genotyping\u2010by\u2010sequencing data for 178 weedy rice samples collected from across the rice growing region of the southern US; these were analysed together with previously published rice and weedy rice genome sequences to determine the recent genomic and population genetic consequences of adaptive introgression and selection for herbicide resistance in US weedy rice populations. We find a reshaped geographical structure of southern US weedy rice as well as purging of crop\u2010derived alleles in some weed strains of crop\u2010weed hybrid origin. Furthermore, we uncover evidence that related weedy rice strains have made use of different genetic mechanisms to respond to selection. Lastly, we identify widespread presence of HR alleles in both hybrid\u2010derived and nonadmixed samples, which further supports an overall picture of weedy rice evolution and adaptation through diverse genetic mechanisms."

    "content": "Abstract\nHow do individuals tolerate both hot and cold climates of our planet? One possibility is that organisms have plastic traits, such as thermal tolerance, that allow them to function in highly variable environments. In this study, we tested whether phenotypic plasticity of temperature tolerance (i.e., acclimatization in the field and acclimation in the lab) occurs in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, at two temporal scales. We first measured the upper and lower critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) of ants monthly for 2\u2009years while concurrently measuring environmental conditions. Both CTmax and CTmin covaried with temperature in a predictable way; values increased in a positive, linear manner. We then experimentally tested whether CTmax and CTmin could shift within a shorter time period by exposing subcolonies of ants to cool (10\u00b0C), moderate (20\u00b0C), and hot (30\u00b0C) temperatures for 10\u2009days. CTmax increased only slightly at the hottest temperature treatment (+1.2\u00b0C); however, CTmin increased considerably under both moderate (+2.6\u00b0C) and hot treatments (+3.8\u00b0C). Combined, our results suggest that the thermal tolerance of ants may be more plastic than originally hypothesized, potentially aiding an already thermophilic clade in future climate scenarios."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Swiss Common Breeding Bird Monitoring (\u201cMonitoring H\u00e4ufige Brutv\u00f6gel\u201d MHB) is a long\u2010term study organized by the Swiss Ornithological Institute. Its main goal is to collect data for estimating breeding population trends of relatively abundant and widespread species. Since 1999, 267 one\u2010km squares laid out in a mostly systematic grid across all of Switzerland have been surveyed annually by skilled, mostly volunteer ornithologists. The sampling sites thus cover a wide range of typical Western European habitats, and an altitudinal range from 250 up to 2750\u2009m above sea level. Bird populations are recorded using a simplified territory mapping protocol with two visits per square above the timberline and three elsewhere. Surveys are conducted during the breeding season (mid\u2010April to early July) along a square\u2010specific transect route that does not change over the years. A typical transect route is between 4 and 6\u2009km long, and each visit usually lasts 3 to 4\u2009h. The location of all visually or acoustically detected birds is recorded on topographical maps or using a smartphone app. Records that meet predefined criteria in terms of species\u2010specific breeding period and observed behavior are retained for the subsequent step of territory delimitation. This is done automatically for most species by the program Autoterri since 2022 and was done manually before, with subsequent checks by an expert. This process finally results in an estimate of the total number of detected territories per species, square and year. The design also explicitly generates detection histories, consisting of two to three numbers that represent the number of territories found to be occupied during each respective visit, enabling the analysis with binomial N\u2010mixture and site\u2010occupancy models. The dataset currently covers the breeding seasons from 1999 to 2024 and includes 6852 site\u2010by\u2010year combinations with estimates of detected territory numbers. It covers 162 of the 166 bird species recorded at least once as potential breeders, excluding four species to prevent potential disturbance at nesting sites. Besides informing about population trends, data from the Swiss Common Breeding Bird Monitoring were used to illustrate several methodological developments in N\u2010mixture, occupancy and related models and to answer scientific and applied questions. With its clearly defined survey method, the largely systematic distribution of its survey sites, and the long timespan covered, it is likely that this dataset will continue to make important contributions in biological and biostatistical research. Herewith, we make the annually updated data set available with a CC BY 4.0 license, allowing researchers and conservationists to use and analyze the data for their own research and conservation efforts."

    "content": "Abstract\nAnalysis of time series data is fundamental in ecology for understanding community dynamics, and the mechanisms driving such dynamics. However, ecological time series commonly contain missing values, which can arise due to methodological changes in monitoring programs, poor weather conditions, logistical constraints, or human error. State\u2010space models are a useful suite of techniques for analyzing ecological time series with missing data. Such models can estimate the unobserved true abundances as latent variables, even for putative census occasions that lack observations. Nevertheless, the impact of missing data on parameter accuracy and precision in these state\u2010space models remains poorly investigated, particularly in species\u2010rich systems. We evaluated the performance of a multivariate process\u2010based state\u2010space model for time series of varying lengths and sampling frequencies, using simulated data informed by empirical counts of reef fish communities from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. We found that despite containing missing data, the models fitted to longer time series produced more accurate and precise parameter estimates compared to shorter, complete\u2010case time series. Additionally, higher spatial replication with uneven census intervals enhanced parameter precision more than maintaining census frequency at the expense of reducing the number of sites. Analysis of reef fish community data revealed attenuation in intrinsic population growth parameters and weaker intraspecific density dependence when modeling longer time series whose inter\u2010census intervals change, while estimates of variability in species' population growth parameters due to environmental fluctuations remained consistent regardless of sampling design. Nonetheless, analyses of shorter, complete\u2010case time series still produced reliable parameter estimates. Our findings highlight the robustness of Bayesian state\u2010space models to missing data, demonstrating that flexibility in long\u2010term monitoring programs does not compromise ecological inference from these models."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change impacts ecosystems directly through differences in species\u2010specific responses as well as indirectly through changes to the strength of species interactions. To predict how species will be impacted by ongoing environmental change, we need to better understand the relative roles of these direct and indirect effects. Salinity is a strong driver of ecological patterns and processes, and salinity regimes in coastal regions are expected to be altered by climate change through the intensification of the hydrological cycle and via climate\u2010driven shifts in the timing and strength of the spring freshet. We hypothesized that hyposalinity can indirectly affect the intertidal community by excluding a dominant guild of herbivores, limpets in the genus Lottia. To test this hypothesis, we (1) conducted intertidal diversity surveys in regions of high versus seasonally low salinity in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, (2) conducted laboratory salinity tolerance trials for two important grazers (Lottia pelta and Lottia digitalis) and one primary producer (Ulva sp.), and (3) experimentally manipulated the abundance of grazers in these two regions. We show that rocky intertidal shores from two regions of disparate salinity regimes are distinct in their intertidal communities: low salinity sites were composed primarily of Mytilus trossulus, Fucus distichus, and Ulva sp., whereas high salinity sites were dominated by Chthamalus dalli, Lottia spp., and Mastocarpus sp. Our laboratory trials confirmed that freshwater inputs experienced in the low salinity region resulted in hyposaline levels which exceeded the tolerance of Lottia spp., but not that of Ulva sp. Further, we show that by excluding grazers in high salinity sites, these communities more closely resemble those of the low salinity sites than those of other high salinity sites with grazers present. Together, these results demonstrate that the pattern of distinct estuarine intertidal communities in low versus high salinity regions in the Strait of Georgia may be largely driven by the indirect effects of freshwater inputs, mediated by salinity\u2010driven differences in herbivore population size and thus grazing pressure."

    "content": "Abstract\nMeta\u2010analysis (MA), a powerful tool for synthesizing reported results, is influential in ecology. While ecologists have long been well\u2010informed on the potential problems associated with nonindependence in experimental work (e.g., pseudoreplication), they have, until recently, largely neglected this issue in MA. However, results used in MAs are likely much more similar when they come from the same locality, system, or laboratory. A simple and common form of nonindependence in MA arises when multiple data points, that is, observed effect sizes, come from the same paper. We obtained original data from 20 published MAs, reconstructed the published analyses, and then, for 14 that had not accounted for a paper effect, used three approaches to evaluate whether within\u2010paper nonindependence was a problem. First, we found that \u201cnonsense\u201d explanatory variables added to the original analyses were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) far more often than the expected 5% (25%\u201350% for four nonsense variables). For example, the number of vowels in the first author's name had a significant effect 50% of the time. Second, we found that an added dummy variable, which was randomly assigned at one of two levels, was statistically significant an average of 38% of the time, far exceeding the expected 5%. Even after including a random paper effect in the analyses, there was still an excess of significant results, suggesting that the within\u2010paper nonindependence was more complex than modeled with the random paper effect. Third, we repeated the original MAs that did not include random paper effects (n\u2009=\u200914 MAs) but added a random paper effect to each revised analysis. In 12 out of the 14 MAs, an added random effect was statistically significant (indicating group nonindependence that was not accounted for in the original analyses), and often the original inferences were substantially altered. Further, incorporating random paper effects was not a sufficient solution to nonindependence. Thus, problems resulting from nonindependence are often substantial, and accounting for the problem will likely require careful consideration of the details of the potential dependence among observed effect sizes. MAs that do not properly account for this problem may reach unwarranted conclusions."

    "content": "Abstract\nCosts of reproduction are predicted to shift under climate change, but the extent to which weaker or stronger costs influence population responses to interannual climate variation is unknown. We asked how seasonal climate, manipulated rainfall, and costs of reproduction influence vital rates and population growth in a long\u2010lived herbaceous perennial plant, Primula hendersonii, across an ongoing rainfall manipulation experiment in oak savanna of northwestern North America. Simulated drought reduced population growth rates, and vital rates (e.g., probability of flowering, individual growth) responded individualistically to variation in winter, spring, and summer temperatures, although not to variation in seasonal precipitation. However, only warmer spring temperatures were associated with a decline in population growth rates. Although we observed a weak negative effect of past reproduction on growth and future reproduction for large individuals, these costs of reproduction ultimately did not influence population growth. Further, observational and manipulative experiments to detect costs of reproduction suggest subtle differences in cost expression. We show that direct climate drivers had a stronger effect on population growth than indirect changes in costs of reproduction and may be more important for understanding population persistence under climate change."

    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the stable coexistence of species despite resource competition has been a central topic in ecology. Ant communities are particularly enigmatic as various species coexist despite resource overlap. Community ecology theory predicts stable species coexistence when intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition, but due to their perennial and underground life, competition coefficients of ants have never been rigorously measured in the field. We tackled this problem by studying Diacamma cf. indicum, which allows for noninvasive mark\u2013recapture of whole colonies. Several ant species coexisted at the study site where Diacamma was most abundant, and baiting experiments and stable isotope analyses suggested overlapping food niches. Consistently, per worker brood production of Diacamma colonies was significantly negatively correlated with con\u2010 and heterospecific worker densities within the foraging area, suggesting exploitative competition among the ants. In terms of net population growth, however, the estimated intraspecific competition coefficient was about five times larger than the interspecific competition coefficient. This is possibly because exploitative competition for food occurs both intra\u2010 and interspecifically, whereas interference competition occurs mostly among conspecifics. Indeed, for Diacamma worker survival, there was a significant (nonlinear) negative correlation only with the density of conspecific colonies within the foraging area. This is consistent with the observation that Diacamma rarely fought with other species, although it violently attacked conspecific aliens encountered in their nest vicinity. We interpreted these results in light of the recent theory of intraspecific adaptation load. This theory predicts that density\u2010dependent adaptation to intraspecific conflict can intensify intraspecific competition and act to suppress per capita population growth in dominant species, thereby leading to species coexistence with overlapping resources. Our inclusive fitness model suggests that the intraspecific territorial aggression in Diacamma may be a counter\u2010adaptation to intraspecific conflict, that is, brood abduction between conspecific colonies. This aggression pattern can cause the observed density\u2010dependent worker mortality. Our population dynamic model indicates that such density\u2010dependent excess mortality acting on dominant competitors can promote stable coexistence with subordinate competitors. Overall, our results support the intraspecific adaptation load theory that aims at integrating behavioral and community ecology to understand how adaptation interacts with population and community dynamics."

Here, we develop a general theoretical framework integrating life\u2010stage structure into community matrix models and show that stage\u2010specific interactions\u2014especially asymmetric predator\u2010prey dynamics\u2014can fundamentally alter stability outcomes. Our findings reveal that such cross\u2010stage interactions can stabilize communities previously deemed unstable, offering new resolution to the classic complexity\u2013stability paradox.\n\nABSTRACT\nThe relationship between ecosystem complexity and stability remains unresolved and a mechanistic explanation for the stunning levels of biodiversity observed in communities and ecosystems is still lacking. The theoretical study of the stability of ecological communities has long been dominated by the assumption that populations are homogeneous. However, populations are structured, consisting of individuals that differ in multiple traits\u2014such as size or developmental stage\u2014with specific energetic demands and use of space and resources. Stage\u2010specific interactions, such as asymmetric competition for resources or predation targeting particular life stages, are widespread in nature and strongly shape ecological dynamics. Recent theoretical work further demonstrates that differences in juvenile versus adult foraging capacity and predation risk can promote the persistence of larger and more complex communities than those predicted by unstructured models. Here, we develop a general framework to integrate population structure into community stability analyses and show that stage\u2010dependent interactions are key to stability. Specifically, while cross\u2010stage predator\u2013prey interactions enhance stability, competition across different stages destabilises the community. Our results offer new insights into the stability\u2010diversity paradox by showing that stage\u2010structured interactions can effectively increase the magnitude of negative feedbacks and compress the unstable region. Overall, we emphasise the critical role of population structure, an often neglected feature of natural systems, in the stability of ecological communities."

    "content": "<p>by Rakshith Lokesh, Dagmar Sternad</p>\n\nManipulating complex objects is ubiquitous in our daily activities, such as donning a jacket or carrying a cup of coffee. However, such non-rigid objects easily become unstable: When carrying a cup of coffee, the coffee could slosh unpredictably and spill out of the cup. It remains unclear what motor control strategies ensure stability, especially when the physical properties of the object, like the amount of liquid in the cup, are unknown. The task of transporting a \u2018cup of coffee\u2019 was simplified to transporting a virtual cup with a sliding ball inside, modeled as a cart-pendulum system. Participants were instructed to \u2018jiggle\u2019 the cup in one dimension to prepare the cup and ball states for the ensuing continuous rhythmic movement. To introduce uncertainty regarding the object\u2019s properties, the pendulum\u2019s length was manipulated either to 1) change randomly from trial to trial, or to 2) remain constant across trials. We measured the ball\u2019s angle at the end of preparation and the cup\u2019s oscillation frequency during the rhythmic portion of the trial. Grip force on the robot handle served as proxy for mechanical impedance of the arm. The results supported three predictions: 1) When dynamic uncertainty was high, object preparation was important to stabilize the transient dynamics; stability increased during preparation and humans prepared longer when the dynamics was uncertain. 2) Humans maximized dynamic stability by flexibly covarying system initialization and cup frequency; dynamic stability matched participant behavior better than magnitude or smoothness of force. 3) Humans increased their arm impedance to accommodate uncertain dynamics, while the net force applied on the cup remained the same. Feedforward simulations using an impedance controller and stochastic open-loop optimal control corroborated these findings, further revealing that participants\u2019 selection of preparation and interaction frequencies also minimized mechanical impedance. In sum, humans used preparation and interaction strategies to optimize the mechanical impedance and dynamic stability of the hand-object interactions. These results may inform approaches in robotic control and rehabilitation."

In this work, we investigate a computational implementation of the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm using genetic search in a generative model, applied to a visual problem-solving task inspired by star constellations. The search is guided by low-level cues based on the structural fitness of candidate solutions compared to the test images. This dataset serves as a testbed for exploring how inferred signals can guide the synthesis of suitable solutions in ambiguous conditions, framing visual inference as an instance of complex problem solving. Drawing on insights from human experiments, we develop a generative search algorithm and compare its performance to humans, examining factors such as accuracy, reaction time, and overlap in drawings. Our results shed light on possible mechanisms of human visual problem solving and highlight the potential of generative search models to emulate aspects of this process."

Engel, Virginie Hamel, Paul Guichard</p>\n\nCentrioles are polarized microtubule-based structures with appendages at their distal end that are essential for cilia formation and function. The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and iterative U-ExM on human cells, together with in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) on mouse tissues, we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centriole\u2019s distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a\u2009~100\u2009nm luminal ring structure consisting of ~27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate \u201cin-to-out\u201d molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation."

    "content": "<p>by Heungjin Ryu, Chie Hashimoto, David A. Hill, Keiko Mouri, Keiko Shimizu, Takeshi Furuichi</p>\n\nIn most mammals, female sexual receptivity (estrus) closely coincides with ovulation, providing males with precise fertility signals. However, in some anthropoid primates living in multi-male societies, females display extended receptivity along with exaggerated sexual swellings that probabilistically indicate ovulation. This raises the question about how males successfully time mating, particularly when ovulation is difficult to predict from such signals. To address this question in bonobos, we combined daily variation in swelling size, hormonal profiles, and male mating behaviors. By estimating day-specific ovulation probabilities relative to the onset and subsidence (detumescence) of maximal swelling, we also examined how male efforts correlate with female fertility. Our results revealed that while ovulation probability was widely distributed and difficult to predict when aligned with the onset of the swelling phase, male behavior was closely aligned with the conception probability. Males concentrated mating efforts late in the phase and stopped after detumescence. High-ranking males intervened in copulations involving females with higher conception probabilities, specifically those with maximal swelling and older infants. When multiple females exhibited maximal swelling, males preferentially followed females whose maximal swelling started earlier and who had older infants. Male\u2013male aggression increased when there were more females with maximal swelling. However, this tendency was reversed when male party size exceeded the average. Importantly, our results revealed that the low predictability of ovulation is best explained by inter- and intra-individual variation in the length of maximal swelling phase, rather than ovulation occurring randomly within that phase in bonobos. Males effectively manage such a noisy signal by prioritizing late-phase ovulatory cues and integrating reproductive history, thereby extracting usable timing information. This behavioral mechanism helps explain the persistence of conspicuous yet noisy ovulatory signals in bonobos. Since males are capable of inferring ovulation timing even under noisy conditions, selection may not favor highly precise female signals. Instead, it shifts more of the time and energy costs onto males, allowing conspicuous female traits to be maintained."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/104054",
    "content": "Some of the most important tasks of visual and motor systems involve estimating the motion of objects and tracking them over time. Such systems evolved to meet the behavioral needs of the organism in its natural environment, and may therefore be adapted to the statistics of motion it is likely to encounter. By tracking the movement of individual points in movies of natural scenes, we begin to identify common properties of natural motion across scenes. As expected, objects in natural scenes move in a persistent fashion, with velocity correlations lasting hundreds of milliseconds. More subtly, but crucially, we find that the observed velocity distributions are heavy-tailed and can be modeled as a Gaussian scale-mixture. Extending this model to the time domain leads to a dynamic scale-mixture model, consisting of a Gaussian process multiplied by a positive scalar quantity with its own independent dynamics. Dynamic scaling of velocity arises naturally as a consequence of changes in object distance from the observer, and may approximate the effects of changes in other parameters governing the motion in a given scene. This modeling and estimation framework has implications for the neurobiology of sensory and motor systems, which need to cope with these fluctuations in scale in order to represent motion efficiently and drive fast and accurate tracking behavior."

    "content": "Although prior research has examined the psychological and neural correlates of guilt and shame, the cognitive antecedents that trigger them, as well as their transformation into social behavior, remain insufficiently understood. We developed a novel task to investigate how two cognitive antecedents, harm and responsibility, elicit guilt and shame, and how these emotions subsequently drive compensatory behavior, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling in human participants. Behaviorally, we found that harm had a stronger impact on guilt, whereas responsibility had a stronger impact on shame. Moreover, compared to shame, guilt exerted a greater effect on compensation. Computational modeling results indicated that the integration of harm and responsibility by individuals is consistent with the phenomenon of responsibility diffusion. The fMRI results revealed that brain regions associated with inequity representation (posterior insula) and value computation (striatum) encode this integrated measure. Individual differences in responsibility-driven shame sensitivity were associated with activity in theory-of-mind regions (e.g. temporoparietal junction). Guilt-driven and shame-driven compensatory behavior recruited distinct neural substrates, with shame-driven compensatory sensitivity being more strongly linked to activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control. Our findings provide computational, algorithmic, and neural accounts of guilt and shame."

    "content": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are increasingly invoked in virtual screening workflows for therapeutics. These mechanistic models project pharmacokinetic outcomes from molecular properties, with data-driven models acting as intermediaries to map molecular structure to PBPK input parameters. Errors in predicted parameters and unvalidated assumptions within PBPK models expose PK predictions to deep uncertainty. Herein, we examine how these uncertainties affect the prediction variability of dynamic, tissue-specific exposure. We validated four PBPK models against 1,854 experimental datapoints - to establish their predictive fidelity before introducing parameter uncertainty typical of property-prediction models. Depending on molecule properties and model choice, the coefficient of variance under parameter uncertainty ranged from 10-5 to 32 for predicted PK statistics. Further, we identified notable model disagreement for a subset of drug-like chemical space characterized by lipophilic, protonated molecules. Uncertainty quantification revealed physicochemical properties and parameter interactions that drove disagreement and highlighted model assumptions that exacerbated prediction variance. Our findings delineate the challenges presented by deep epistemic uncertainty in PBPK modeling."

    "content": "Ticks are ectoparasites that modulate host responses to sustain prolonged blood feeding, and in Ixodes ricinus, salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) represent promising candidates for manipulating host gene expression. Using phylogenetic footprinting combined with cooperative targeting analysis, we identified deeply conserved miRNA-mRNA interactions that appear essential for the tick lifecycle and its ability to parasitize diverse vertebrate hosts. Our findings show that conserved tick miRNAs can mimic host miRNAs by exploiting shared target sites on host transcripts, allowing them to modulate regulatory circuits critical during tick feeding. We identified twelve core salivary miRNAs-highly expressed and enriched in conserved target sites-that cooperatively target twenty-two human genes predominantly expressed in skin and neural tissues. This cooperative suppression converges on host hub genes like PDGFRA and NRG1, linking tick miRNA activity to MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways that regulate immune defense, tissue repair, and sensory responses. Overall, our results demonstrate that I. ricinus miRNAs can synergistically disrupt host homeostasis, and they introduce a broadly applicable framework that leverages evolutionary conservation to detect meaningful cross-species miRNA-mRNA interactions."

    "content": "Motivation: Understanding interactions from microbiome data is a central aspect in microbial ecology, as it provides insights into ecosystem stability, disease mechanisms, and can be used to design synthetic communities. Current network inference tools reconstruct global networks from co-abundance data, which means they capture the overall correlation structure for the entire set of taxa considered. These approaches are computationally intensive and suboptimal when the focus is on the local neighborhood of specific taxa of interest. Results: We introduce NeighborFinder, a local network inference method that enables the targeted discovery of direct neighbors around a species of interest. Using cross-validated multiple linear regression with {ell}1 penalty and microbiome specific filters, our approach infers interpretable species-centered interactions, with F1 score [&ge;] 0.95 on simulated cohorts ranging from 250 to 1000 samples. This method is well-suited for large metagenomic datasets and is particularly valuable for exploratory studies where the targeted hypotheses outweigh the need for global community structure. The approach complements existing methods by being a biologically intuitive and computationally efficient. Availability and Implementation: The R package is freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/ metagenopolis/NeighborFinder.

    "content": "Aging and tissue repair involve multilayered and spatially heterogeneous remodeling across transcriptional, biochemical, and cellular dimensions, yet prevailing definitions rely on isolated molecular markers that obscure how biochemical and transcriptional states co-evolve in tissues. Here we present RamanOmics, a multimodal framework that integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and label-free Raman imaging to map the spatial vibrational-biochemical and molecular architecture of aging and senescence directly in intact tissues. Applied to mouse lung and skin, RamanOmics generates spatially resolved biochemical-molecular maps revealing tissue-specific programs: lung senescent cells are enriched for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and TGF-b; signaling (Serpine1, Dab2, Igfbp7), whereas skin senescence is dominated by keratinization and barrier homeostasis modules (Krt10, Lor, Sbsn). Across tissues, we identify a conserved branched-chain fatty-acid-linked biochemical profile and Raman signature (1131-1135 cm-1) that robustly marks p21+ senescent cells. To unify these layers, we develop a machine learning derived multimodal barcode that quantitatively integrates biochemical and transcriptional features, enabling non-destructive identification of senescence in situ. In a wound-healing model, RamanOmics further reveals coordinated reactivation of barrier-repair programs in senescent cells, marked by upregulation of Krt10, Lor, Sbsn, Sfn, and Dmkn together with matching increases in lipid-associated Raman signatures, confirming biological generalizability beyond steady-state aging. By directly integrating gene programs to spatial vibrational-biochemical states, RamanOmics provides a general framework and resource for scalable, multimodal profiling of cellular states."

    "content": "The Getah virus (GETV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus in the Togaviridae family and the Alphavirus genus, associated with severe disease outbreaks in livestock across the Asia-Pacific regions. Since its first isolation in Malaysia in 1955, GETV has been reported in Eurasia and the South Pacific, yet documented cases in the United States remain exceptionally rare, leaving major gaps in regional vector competence and surveillance data. To evaluate the potential of local mosquito populations as GETV carriers, field collections were conducted in Montgomery and Pike Road neighborhoods of Alabama from 2023 to 2024, capturing multiple mosquito species for molecular screening. Initial real-time qPCR assays on 200 pooled and individual samples suggested that approximately 30% of specimens demonstrated possible GETV carriage potential. To validate viral presence, two distinct primer sets were designed to amplify viral genome fragments. Mosquito RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by nested conventional PCR. The first PCR, targeting ~280 bp, produced single or multiple amplicon bands in 32% of samples via gel electrophoresis. These positive cDNAs were re-amplified with a second primer pair targeting a ~430 bp fragment from a separate genomic region, yielding confirmatory bands in 30% of specimens. Amplified products were purified and Sanger sequenced, revealing approximately 95% nucleotide similarity to the wild-type GETV reference genome. This study delivers the first field-based molecular evidence supporting GETV detection in Alabama mosquitoes, signaling either localized emergence or potential introduction of the virus. These findings underscore the need for expanded vector competence profiling, arboviral surveillance, and livestock disease preparedness in the southeastern United States, strengthening both public health readiness and state-level vector monitoring strategies."

This study investigated the impact of two soy-based foods, soymilk-burkina (SMB), a traditional fermented Ghanaian beverage) and soymilk-millet blend (SMMB), on the gut microbiome of women of reproductive age. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from two cohorts of women consuming either SMB or SMMB soymilk-burkina or a soymilk-millet blend) at 2 weeks pre-intervention, baseline, during an 8-week intervention, and 4 weeks post-intervention. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to analyze the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome. Results: Beta-diversity analysis revealed no significant differences in overall community composition between the two cohorts. Alpha-diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson) showed no significant differences in richness, evenness, or diversity between cohorts, suggesting a balanced gut ecosystem after both interventions. However, 20 dominant bacterial species were identified, including both beneficial (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides vulgatus) and potentially harmful (e.g., Eubacterium rectale and Bacteroides fragilis) taxa. Soymilk-burkina consumption of soymilk-burkina significantly reduced the abundance of Eubacterium rectale (associated with colon cancer) and increased the abundance of F. prausnitzii (beneficial), suggesting potential gut health benefits. However, these effects were transient, highlighting the need for sustained dietary interventions. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the dynamic interplay between diet and the gut microbiome, particularly in the context of traditional fermented foods such as soymilk-burkina. Although short-term changes were observed, the long-term benefits may require consistent consumption. Further research is required to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and their implications on broader health outcomes."

    "content": "Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are a mechanism to control microbial infections conserved across the host species of the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Cysteine S-nitrosylation (SNO) is a reversible post-translational modification that controls complex cell behaviors by regulating protein interactions and signal transduction events. Here we identified a cluster of T. gondii secreted effector proteins that are SNO-modified in a host inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS)-dependent manner. Among these were the rhoptry protein 5 (ROP5) paralogs, which are the major virulence determinants in T. gondii and an immunodominant antigen in B6 mice. ROP5 was necessary for Type I and Type II parasites to evade IFN-{gamma}-mediated immune clearance in iNOS-deficient macrophages. RNS led to the loss of ROP5 association with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, which is necessary for the known functions of ROP5. Infection with ROP5 knockout parasites rescued the susceptibility of iNOS-deficient mice to infection with Type II T. gondii. Together, these data indicate that RNS can promote cell-autonomous parasite clearance by inhibiting the function of ROP5 paralogs at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane."

Phylogenetic group B2 Escherichia coli (Ec) is frequently isolated from UTI patients, although non-B2 strains have also been isolated. The latter can be associated with Enterococcus faecalis (Ef). UTI involves bacterial growth in the disparate environments of the bladder and intracellularly in uroepithelial cells. The bladder is a low-nutrient environment that nonetheless supports rapid growth. We characterized the interaction between three co-isolated Ec-Ef pairs and other Ec-Ef combinations in a nutrient-rich medium which ws intended to emulate the rapid growth condition of the bladder. In this rich medium, Ef had little effect on Ec growth but resulted in major transcriptome differences. The Ec-Ef interactions were not strain-specific, although Ef affected the non-B2 and B2 strains differently. For the non-B2 Ec strains, Ef induced transcript for genes whose products degrade ornithine via putrescine to succinate which is subsequently metabolized by the TCA cycle. For a control B2 Ec strain, Ef induced transcripts for similar enzymes, except for those that degrade putrescine to succinate, but also for growth rate-associated genes of macromolecular synthesis. Unexpectedly, Ef induced transcripts for glyoxylate shunt enzymes in both non-B2 and B2 Ec strains. The bacterial environments during UTI are disparate and changing, which will require several layers of Ec-Ef interactions. Our results provide evidence for nutrient cross-feeding as one type of Ec-Ef interaction."

    "content": "Diderm bacteria use contact-dependent Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) to gain a competitive advantage within bacterial communities and during infection. Whereas the structural core assembly of T6SS is well characterized, the role of diverse accessory proteins during assembly remains under investigation. One well-conserved accessory protein is TagF, a post-translational inhibitor of T6SS dynamics, which was previously characterized in the context of a kinase-phosphatase signaling relay. Here, we identify a subset of T6SS clusters in which TagF occurs in a distinct regulatory context and without known binding partners. Investigating the role of TagF in the constitutively active Acinetobacter baylyi T6SS, we show that though TagF can suppress assembly dynamics, it primarily acts as an assembly coordinator. Using structured illumination microscopy, we show that TagF coordinates the transition from baseplate assembly to sheath elongation by preventing premature and nonproductive sheath assembly in absence of the VgrG spike. Direct interactions with the conserved T6SS tube protein Hcp suggested that TagF blocks sheath elongation by binding and disrupting Hcp hexamers and thus preventing tube formation. Finally, we show that TagF activity depends on crosstalk with TagZ, a previously uncharacterized membrane associated accessory protein that recruits TagF to the cell periphery, and demonstrate that this interaction can be specifically disrupted by expression of an artificial TagF-binding protein. Together, our [fi]ndings establish a novel role of TagF as a checkpoint protein that controls for spike-insertion into the baseplate to ensure effective T6SS assembly."

    "content": "The inflammation induced by Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the female genital tract (FGT) can have severe consequences. Recent observations in women and mice infected with Chlamydia suggest that type I interferon (IFN-I) may have deleterious effects. This study aimed at elucidating the consequences of IFN-I production on C. trachomatis-induced inflammation in epithelial cells and the molecular pathway(s) involved. We showed that combination of IFN-I and Chlamydia resulted in a stronger induction of inflammation than Chlamydia alone, while IFN-I alone had no effect. Inhibiting AKT and mTOR, but not silencing STAT1, significantly attenuated the synergetic effect between IFN-I and bacteria on inflammation. Inhibition of ERK also blocked this synergistic effect, although ERK were not activated by IFN-I. We hypothesized that IFN-I enhanced the expression of a pathogen recognition receptor of the host, thereby potentiating detection of the bacteria and the subsequent inflammatory response. IFN-I, but not C. trachomatis infection, increased the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and silencing or knocking-out TLR3 prevented the synergetic effect between infection and IFN-I. Furthermore, our data support the presence of dsRNA in infected cells and the activation of the MAPK/ERK and AP-1/ATF2 signaling cascades downstream of TLR3. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IFN-I exacerbates the host inflammatory response triggered by Chlamydia by increasing TLR3 expression and activation, leading to hyperinflammation. The identified signaling cascades represent potential targets for therapeutical intervention to limit tissue damage upon Chlamydia infection."

    "content": "DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes found in all cells, where they regulate DNA supercoiling. Reverse gyrase (RG) is a unique type of topoisomerase that introduces positive supercoils into DNA and appears exclusively in hyperthermophiles where it was proposed to play a key, yet still elusive, role. Here, we investigate RG activity in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis at 85C, its optimal growth temperature, using genetics and functional genomics assays. Deletion of RG led to a loss of positive supercoiling in plasmid DNA and the reduced dynamic range of transcription, without affecting histone occupancy. To investigate the effects of RG loss on the topology of chromosomal DNA, we established a psoralen photobinding assay (TMP-seq) in T. kodakarensis under native growth conditions. TMP enrichment patterns were consistent with the twin-domain model of transcription and further revealed that promoters of expressed transcription units are, on average, underwound. TMP-seq profiles in an RG deletion strain revealed that promoters are hotspots for RG activity, consistent with RG acting on hyper-negatively supercoiled substrates. We propose that RG acts not as a global modulator of supercoiling, but as a local genome guardian, selectively stabilising vulnerable regulatory regions to ensure a delicate balance between DNA accessibility and integrity under extremely high temperatures."

Understanding these changes across length scales is crucial for elucidating bacterial lifecycles, informing antifouling surface design, enhancing pathogen detection, and advancing renewable energy applications. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) enables high-resolution imaging of bacterial structures in hydrated, biologically relevant conditions. However, current quantitative analysis strategies that extract structural information from bacterial samples remain labor-intensive. This work presents an AI-driven segmentation workflow tailored to low-dose cryoEM datasets to rapidly analyze bacterial ultrastructural features from Pantoea sp. YR343, a Gram-negative bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of Populus deltoides that forms robust biofilms along plant roots. YOLOv11 image segmentation quantifies inner and outer membrane thickness and flagella length, enabling automated analysis of bacterial ultrastructure. The workflow reliably distinguishes membranes from carbon edges of the TEM grid and contaminant crystalline ice while matching manual measurements and increasing throughput. Flagella detection routines additionally quantify nearest-neighbor proximity between bacterial envelopes and flagella. A field-of-view module further detects bacteria at low magnification for rapid screening.

Brain injury and microglial activation are major determinants of outcome, yet the mechanisms linking infection, inflammation and neuronal injury remain poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), key mediators of cell-to-cell communication, have been investigated in pulmonary TB but their role in TB meningitis remains unexplored. We used our young rabbit model of TB meningitis to isolate pure, intact EVs from brain tissue (i.e., brain-derived EVs) from infected and uninfected rabbits and used nanoflow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and protein quantification to characterize the EVs. Comparative proteomic profiling was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by in silico pathway, cell-type and protein-protein interaction analyses using DAVID, Enrichr, and STRING databases. We found that EV isolation from fresh and frozen tissue was equivalent and demonstrated that M. tuberculosis infection activated EV biogenesis. Despite preserved vesicle morphology, EVs from infected brain showed a significant proteomic shift characterized by enrichment of TB host defense, microglial and immune activation, metabolic excitotoxicity, and neuronal injury. These proteome dysregulations suggest that infection reprograms brain EV cargo toward proinflammatory and metabolic stress responses while depleting neuronal and mitochondrial components. Collectively, these data demonstrate that M. tuberculosis infection alters the cargo and abundance of brain-derived EV, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and mediators of host-pathogen interactions in TB meningitis."

    "content": "Bacteria control individualistic and group behaviors using a form of cell-cell communication called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing relies on the production of chemical signals called autoinducers and the subsequent detection of those signals by a cognate receptor. Many Gram-negative bacteria use the LuxR-type family of transcription factor receptors that bind to acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducer signals to regulate their function as DNA-binding proteins. A subclass of this family of transcription factor receptors requires their cognate autoinducer to fold and dimerize to bind DNA to regulate gene expression and, thus, traits associated with quorum sensing, such as biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we use a chemical-genetic approach to determine the structural basis for ligand selection by the quorum-sensing receptor RhlR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The native ligand for RhlR is N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, and this protein-ligand interaction is important for initiating gene expression in P. aeruginosa. We determine key residues that drive ligand specificity and selectivity of RhlR to define the role of ligand-driven RhlR-dependent gene regulation of quorum-sensing traits, namely the differential expression of the phenazine genes, which encode the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the redox-sensitive virulence factor pyocyanin, among other phenazines. Furthermore, we provide a chemical-genetic framework for future studies aimed at disrupting the RhlR-ligand interaction to suppress virulence in P. aeruginosa, an important nosocomial pathogen with widespread antimicrobial resistance."

Unintentional low-level exposure to ciprofloxacin, e.g., environmental or food-borne, might provide sufficiently high selection pressure to maintain resistance and compensate potential fitness costs. We used a mathematical within-host model of gonorrhoea to investigate the effect of low-level ciprofloxacin exposure on susceptibility. We present a mechanistic within-host model of gonococcal infections in the male urethra, to simulate the influence of low-level ciprofloxacin exposures on gonococcal ciprofloxacin susceptibility. We assessed the impact of repeated exposures to varying amounts of ciprofloxacin (0-0.75mg/day) in a chain of sequentially transmitted infections. Daily exposure to at least 0.15mg ciprofloxacin was sufficient to select for low-level resistance. Moreover, in the absence of ciprofloxacin treatment, resistant variants could revert back to variants with lower levels of resistance. However, background exposure can balance fitness costs of resistance and prevent a complete reversion to the fully susceptible variant. Even for human-host restricted pathogens such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a One Health approach that considers unintentional antibiotic exposures is needed to avoid the emergence and spread of resistance."

Historical data demonstrates that H7 outbreaks in Australia do not occur randomly, rather, there is a strong association between the timing of the previous H7 outbreaks and rainfall patterns in southeastern Australia. We aimed to address a hypothesis wherein prior to H7 outbreaks in poultry, there was a detectable change in H7 prevalence and/or virus diversity in wild bird populations. We addressed this using virological and serological surveillance data generated from multiple programs. Despite the collection of thousands of samples, there was only weak evidence to support our hypothesis, which provides strong incentive to evaluate current surveillance approaches for the purposes of risk prediction. However, in alignment with a previous analysis, there is strong support for a relationship between H7 outbreak probability and rainfall patterns across southeast Australia. Overall, improved understanding of the ecology and evolution of H5 and H7 viruses in wild bird reservoirs is pivotal to global disease preparedness and response."

Experimental testing of 9 candidates validated 6 with anti-phage activity. These include DarTG and ietAS system variants that have acquired helicase modules, and a Gabija system in which a MazF-like protein replaces GajA, implying novel anti-phage mechanisms. We also identified a new clade of Pycsar and show that it synergizes with type IV Thoeris to broaden phage protection.

Here, we examined how two antibiotics frequently used in perinatal care, broad-spectrum ampicillin (AMP) and the extended-spectrum combination amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMOX/CLAV), administered during gestation and lactation, influence neonatal gut microbiome composition, fecal metabolome profiles, and responses to the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20). Maternal treatment with AMOX/CLAV, but not AMP, significantly reduced PCV-specific IgG titers at 4- and 6-weeks post-prime immunization compared to untreated controls. Exclusive exposure to AMOX/CLAV also impaired neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytic killing, indicating diminished antibody functionality. These effects were transient, with immune parameters normalizing by week 8 post-prime immunization. Metabolomic and microbiome profiling revealed that maternal AMP and AMOX/CLAV differentially perturbed specific metabolite classes including bile acids, N-acyl lipids, and indole-derivatives, as well as key commensal taxa including Bacteroidales and Coriobacteriales within the gut microbiota. Together, these findings reveal a previously underappreciated maternal-offspring route of antibiotic influence that transiently disrupts neonatal vaccine responsiveness through microbiome and metabolome alterations. These results highlight maternal antibiotic exposure as a modifiable factor shaping early-life immunity."

Climate change is altering the transmission dynamics of this disease; however, the direction and magnitude of this change remain uncertain due to a lack of mechanistically grounded predictions at continental scale. In this study, we developed a novel risk index to assess how climate change may affect the potential for fascioliasis transmission across Africa and Europe. The index integrates the following three components that together capture the environmental requirements for Fasciola transmission: the temperature dependence of the parasite transmission; climatic suitability for the snail intermediate host; and availability of freshwater habitats. To estimate these components, we used data from published experimental studies, thousands of snail occurrence records, and both mechanistic and correlative modelling approaches. We predict that climate change will generally reduce fascioliasis risk across most of the ranges of the two investigated liver fluke species, albeit with marked geographical differences. The transmission risk of F. gigantica is predicted to decrease in the Sahel and West Africa, due to above-optimal temperatures for parasite transmission and climatic suitability for the intermediate hosts. However, risk for F. hepatica transmission is projected to increase in parts of Northern Europe, Scandinavia, and Iceland, where livestock densities are high. We also find that the potential for hybridization between F. hepatica and F. gigantica may decline due to reduced geographic overlap in areas that are highly suitable for transmission. By providing a scalable, ecologically informed framework for predicting fascioliasis risk under climate change, this study lays the groundwork for improved local risk assessment. Our results provide a more nuanced perspective on the potential impact of climate change on fascioliasis transmission, showing that this will be highly uneven across Africa and Europe."

Data were collected from 142 published papers covering a period between 1979 to 2023. Information related to statistics terminology, the softwares cited and R software packages were retrieved. Each paper had on average eight statistical procedures and there was a significant increase in procedures over the years. The R software was cited in almost 80 percent of studies, surpassing by far the other softwares. Classical analyses such as t tests, correlations and chi-squares are still used in research; nonetheless, from 2012 onward a new set of analyses including GLM, GLMM and Networks have emerged and are being used as the leading analyses in studies of plant-ant interactions. This coincides with the adoption of R software by scientists in this field. The most used R packages were vegan, lme4 and bipartite, followed by several other related to linear (mixed) models. Statistics literacy is a mandatory aspect of research in plant ant interactions. The increase in statistical procedures over the years, as well as the emergence of new tests can be considered as a natural evolution of the field with demand for robustness in methods and analyses."

In it, the singular electronic quantum geometric tensor\u2014Abelian for adiabatic dynamics and non-Abelian for nonadiabatic dynamics\u2014is fully encoded in the global electronic overlap matrix. Numerical illustrations demonstrate that atomic motion, whether adiabatic or nonadiabatic, is governed not only by variations in electronic energies (potential energy surfaces) but also by variations in electronic states (electronic quantum geometry). Beyond quantum molecular dynamics, the strategy of discrete local trivialization can be extended to describe quantum dynamics, possibly non-Hermitian, on arbitrary, especially nondifferential fiber bundles.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Their role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), particularly in ferroptosis regulation, remains unclear. Here, we identify human endogenous retrovirus-H (HERVH) derived enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) aberrantly overexpressed in PDAC by integrating gene expression and histone modification data. Silencing HERVH markedly suppresses PDAC proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcription is driven by the super-enhancer\u2013associated transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), and HERVH eRNAs cooperate with KLF5 to transactivate a distal super-enhancer upstream of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member 3 (ALDH1A3), increasing its expression. ALDH1A3 inhibits the reactive oxygen species/specificity protein 1/spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (ROS/Sp1/SAT1) cascade, reducing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Disrupting this axis induces ferroptotic death and impairs PDAC development.

This study presents a simple method for producing IWNs on ultrathin polyimide (PI) films. An ultraviolet laser irradiates the PI-glass interface, generating gas that induces the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanobubbles, leading to the formation of nanopillars at the interface. Mechanical peeling then delaminates the PI film from glass along the middle of these nanopillars, creating IWNs on both PI film and glass.

A poleward-propagating Rossby wave train, forced by divergent winds associated with the Western Pacific (WP) pattern, links WP to BKS sea ice variability by inducing lower-atmospheric circulation anomalies over the North Atlantic that enhance poleward heat and moisture transport.

    "content": "<div id=\"abstracts\">\n <div>\n  <section id=\"abstract\">\n   <h2>\n    Abstract\n   </h2>\n   <div>\n    The efficacy of oral delivery of biologic drugs for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment is substantially compromised by the swift enzymatic degradation and insufficient retention of biologics in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we report a simple method for fabricating fluidic microgel assemblies (FMGAs) by introducing the hydrogen bonds between the microgel surfaces. These FMGAs with water content of 77% are flowable yet immiscible with water. Upon oral administration, these FMGAs form a large-area physical adhesive coating on the intestinal surface, extending intestinal retention time to at least 48 hours. The intermicrogel spaces within the assemblies can efficiently harbor therapeutic biologics (such as exosomes and TNF\u03b1 antibody), protect them from the harsh intestinal microenvironment, and enable efficient delivery to intestinal lesion sites to restore intestinal barrier function and microbiota diversity in mouse and beagle models of IBD. We believe that the fluidic microgel assembly strategy holds great promise for oral delivery of labile biologics for the treatment of diverse gastrointestinal diseases.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Here, we investigated how the brain categorizes stimuli that are not linearly separable in the physical world by analyzing the geometry of neural manifolds formed by macaque V2 neurons during a classification task involving motion-induced illusory contours. We identified two related but distinct neural manifolds: the sensory and perceptual manifolds. The sensory manifold was embedded in a three-dimensional subspace defined by three stimulus features, where contour orientations remained linearly inseparable. However, through a sequence of geometric transformations equivalent to twist operations, this three-dimensional sensory manifold expanded into a seven-dimensional perceptual manifold, enabling the linear separability of contour orientations. Computational modeling further demonstrated that this dimension expansion was facilitated by neurons exhibiting nonlinear mixed selectivity with heterogeneous response profiles. These findings provide insights into how biological neural networks enhance the dimensionality of representational spaces, illuminating the geometric mechanism underlying the transformation from sensation to perception.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

So far, experimental validation has been restricted to functional assays and model organisms. Large-scale biobanking now makes it possible to directly assess phenotypic consequences in living adults. Querying exomes of 455,000 UK Biobank participants at 37 sites with supposedly fixed human-specific changes, we identified 103 carriers at 17 positions, with variable allele counts across ancestries. We performed phenotypic evaluations for two example changes. Individuals carrying archaic\n    <i>\n     SSH2\n    </i>\n    alleles showed no clear deviations in an array of health, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive traits.

Here, we explore industrialization\u2019s impact at the individual scale by analyzing skeletal concentrations of pollutants (arsenic, barium, and lead) and evaluating biogenic versus diagenetic contributions. Analysis of the skeletal remains of 94 individuals from two 18th/19th century English towns, South Shields and Barton-upon-Humber, showed biogenic exposure to contaminants and variation in exposure by environment and biosocial identity. South Shields individuals showed higher concentrations of arsenic (\n    <i>\n     P\n    </i>\n    &lt;\u00a00.001) and barium (\n    <i>\n     P\n    </i>\n    =\u00a00.013), while Barton-upon-Humber individuals showed higher concentrations of lead (\n    <i>\n     P\n    </i>\n    =\u00a00.020).

Although beer is generally considered microbiologically stable, recent findings indicate that hops can harbour viable fungal and bacterial strains with potential effects on beer quality and hop creep enzymes. We investigated the fungal DNA reservoir of commercial hop pellets and its transfer into beer during dry hopping. Using ITS2 metabarcoding, we characterized fungal communities in hop pellets, pre-hopping beer, and dry-hopped beer, complemented by untargeted volatile profiling (HS-SPME-GCMS). Hop pellets contained diverse fungal assemblages dominated by common foliar endophytes. Several yeast genera of fermentative or spoilage relevance were also detected, including <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Saccharomyces, Wickerhamomyces, Rhodotorula</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Debaryomyces</span>. While most taxa were found only in hops, four genera (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wickerhamomyces, Vishniacozyma, Bipolaris, Curvularia</span>) were additionally found in dry-hopped beer but absent from pre-hopping samples, indicating transfer from hops. Metabolomic screening revealed that, besides enrichment of hop-derived metabolites, dry hopping induced shifts in volatile profiles through increases in ethyl esters, higher alcohols, and short-chain fatty acids. Our results demonstrate that commercial hop pellets carry diverse fungal assemblages and that their DNA is detectable in beer after dry hopping, together with aroma shifts consistent with microbial or enzymatic activity.</span>"

However, there has been insufficient investigation of the riverine N\u2010removal processes on the Qinghai\u2010Tibet Plateau (QTP). This study investigated the driving mechanisms of denitrification and anammox in 23 small rivers using multiple approaches (remote sensing, 15N pairing, and molecular techniques). The rivers span large elevational and climatic gradients, offering an ideal window for studying the riverine N\u2010removal processes, especially in the context of global change. The denitrification rates were 1.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.88\u00a0mg\u00a0N/kg/d in summer and 0.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26\u00a0mg\u00a0N/kg/d in winter, which dominated the total riverine N removal (96% and 73%, respectively). Structural equation models (SEM) revealed that geographic factors (elevation and land use), water properties (water temperature, pH, etc.), sediment parameters (moisture, NO3\u2212\u2010N, NH4+\u2010N, etc.), and microbial gene abundances collectively explained over 60% of the variation in N\u2010removal rates, with sediment properties being the primary regulating factors in summer. In winter, SEM showed that the contribution of geographic factors increased. We proposed a framework combining cross\u2010perspective methods for revealing in\u2010river N removal mechanisms and predicted that, under global change, N removal processes in rivers on the QTP are likely to intensify in the future. The integrated approaches systematically offered critical insights into the processes and drivers of biogeochemical N cycling on the QTP."

    "content": "Abstract\nSeasonal variability of the magnitude and structure of semidiurnal internal tides radiated from the Mariana Arc was examined based on year\u2010long mooring observations. Internal tidal currents, energy density, and energy flux at the focal point of the Mariana Arc were weakest in summer, but typically comparable in the other three seasons. Mode\u20101 internal tides dominate over the observed period, except in summer when Mode\u20102 explains a higher proportion. The coherent variance accounts for about 60% of the total semidiurnal motions, with a reduced proportion in summer and winter, generally consistent with the seasonal trend of the barotropic tides. In contrast, the incoherent internal tides show a close temporal consistency with the low\u2010frequency flows. During summer, the background currents are predominantly influenced by energetic mesoscale eddies, whereas the North Equatorial Current (NEC) system dominates in the other seasons. Internal tides influenced by eddies exhibit more standing wave characteristics, higher modal structures, and more incoherent properties compared to those modulated by the NEC. Internal tides are more progressive and propagate outward more easily when modulated by the NEC, whereas those modulated by eddies are more unstable and prone to nearby dissipation, resulting in a significant summer weakening at the Mariana Arc focus."

A coupled hydrodynamic\u2014sediment transport model, the Regional Ocean Modeling System\u2014Community Sediment Transport Modeling System, was implemented within the Coupled Ocean\u2010Atmosphere\u2010Wave\u2010Sediment Transport (COAWST) Modeling System for the 2020 open water season on the Alaskan Beaufort Sea shelf. Results showed that wave\u2010 and current\u2010induced bed shear stresses were frequently capable of resuspending sediment. Waves dominated bed shear stresses in depths shallower than 10\u00a0m and currents dominated in depths deeper than 20\u00a0m. Suspended sediment flux directions oscillated with the currents, which were eastward on average. However, since large waves tended to occur during westward currents, time\u2010averaged suspended sediment fluxes on the inner shelf were westward. Sensitivity tests were performed where significant wave heights were (a) set to zero and (b) doubled, which showed that waves increased the fraction of time that sediment could be resuspended by up to 50% and increased westward suspended sediment fluxes on the inner shelf. Overall, the results improve our understanding of how waves impact sediment fluxes on the Beaufort Sea shelf during the open water season and suggest that terrestrially derived sediment may be transported westward along the inner shelf."

    "content": "Abstract\nAlgal dynamics are fundamental drivers of lotic ecosystem processes. Although rivers tend to be heterotrophic and have low standing stocks of autotrophic biomass, filamentous algae can cause nuisance algal blooms that alter the structure of the autotrophic assemblage. Still, the influence of these blooms on ecosystem processes can be variable. Here, we examined the structural and functional contribution of filamentous and epilithic algae by linking algal biomass measurements to daily primary production fluxes throughout two growing seasons in six sites along the Upper Clark Fork River, an open canopy, snow melt river in western Montana, USA. We partitioned daily productivity estimates across different algal groups using the spatial and temporal variability in algal assemblages across our six sites. By using reach\u2010scale metabolism estimates, we assessed the in situ functional rates of individual algal groups. Throughout two growing seasons, we measured high fluxes of ecosystem productivity and spatially variable filamentous algal blooms. We found that the filamentous algal blooms determined the ecosystem structure in terms of total biomass and algal turnover times, but not the ecosystem functions of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, or net production. Whole\u2010reach estimates of epilithic and filamentous algae growth rates were 0.30 and 0.026 day\u2009\u22121$$ {}^{-1} $$ respectively, which are similar to rates measured in mesocosms. The epilithic algae grew and turned over rapidly, dominating total biomass production and driving ecosystem function while filamentous algae grew slowly and built up large amounts of biomass during a growing season, shaping the structure, but not function, of the ecosystem."

We assessed the distribution of mussel and fish life history strategies across 80 sites spanning aspects of the river continuum concept within the Ouachita Highlands (USA) and asked if their distributions are predicted by a similar life history strategy framework. Because mussel and fish assemblages should both be structured by selective forces in an up\u2010 to downstream trajectory, we expected both taxa to converge on more species\u2010rich assemblages with a greater proportion of equilibrium strategists in larger, more stable downstream habitats.

Emil Thomasen, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Gaston Courtade</p>\n\nThe activity of GT-B glycosyltransferases depends on their conformational flexibility and high substrate specificity, but the molecular basis of these features is still not well defined. The GT70 family contains a single well-characterized enzyme, GumK, a glucuronosyltransferase from <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> required for xanthan gum biosynthesis. Here, we applied multiscale molecular simulations and sequence analysis to probe GumK dynamics and substrate specificity. We show that GumK undergoes twisting and bending motions constrained by interdomain contacts and modulated by membrane anchoring. Acceptor-substrate binding within an amphiphilic clamp promotes opening, whereas donor-substrate binding stabilizes closure, defining a substrate-dependent catalytic cycle. Specificity for UDP-glucuronate is mediated by a conserved electrostatic environment centered on Lys307 and a hydrophobic triad that orients the sugar moiety. On the acceptor side, the binding site selectively accommodates polyisoprenyl carriers up to three isoprene units in length and wraps around the substrate, constraining the trisaccharide moiety in a catalytically competent conformation. Comparative analysis highlights GumK-specific motifs that distinguish it from homologous GTs. This work provides mechanistic insight into the GT70 family and the dynamic behavior of GT-B enzymes, establishing principles for the rational engineering of GumK to modify the monosaccharide composition of xanthan gum."

Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models\u2014entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models\u2014have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavioral, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior."

Robert Frost</p>\n\nSpatial transcriptomics (ST) provides critical insights into the spatial organization of gene expression, enabling researchers to unravel the intricate relationship between cellular environments and biological function. Identifying spatial domains within tissues is key to understanding tissue architecture and mechanisms underlying development and disease progression. Here, we present Randomized Spatial PCA (RASP), a novel spatially-aware dimensionality reduction method for ST data. RASP is designed to be orders-of-magnitude faster than existing techniques, scale to datasets with 100,000+ locations, support flexible integration of non-transcriptomic covariates, and reconstruct de-noised, spatially-smoothed gene expression values. RASP itself is not a clustering or domain detection method; cell types and spatial regions are obtained by clustering the RASP PCs, and the effective cluster resolution depends on the K-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph and a smoothing parameter <i>\u03b2</i>. It employs a randomized two-stage PCA framework and configurable spatial smoothing. RASP was compared to BASS, GraphST, SEDR, SpatialPCA, STAGATE, and CellCharter using diverse ST datasets (10x Visium, Stereo-Seq, MERFISH, 10x Xenium) on human and mouse tissues. In these benchmarks, RASP delivers comparable or superior accuracy in tissue-domain detection while achieving substantial improvements in computational speed. Its efficiency not only reduces runtime and resource requirements but also makes it practical to explore a broad range of spatial-smoothing parameters in a high-throughput fashion. By enabling rapid re-analysis under different parameter settings, RASP empowers users to fine-tune the balance between resolution and noise suppression on large, high-resolution subcellular datasets\u2014a critical capability when investigating complex tissue architecture."

    "content": "<p>by Adhithi Lakshmikanthan, Minnie Kay, Pim J.A. Oomen</p>\n\nBiological sex plays a crucial role in the outcomes of cardiac health and therapies. Sex hormones are known to strongly influence cardiac remodeling through intracellular signaling pathways, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this need, we developed and validated a logic-based systems biology model of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy that, for the first time, incorporates the effects of both estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) alongside well-established hypertrophic stimuli (Strain, angiotensin II (AngII), and endothelin-1 (ET-1)). We qualitatively validated the model to literature data with 82% agreement. Quantitative validation was done by simulating the impact of the inputs (E2, T, Strain, AngII, and ET-1) on cardiac hypertrophy, captured as change in CellArea. We perturbed the validated model to examine the differential response to hypertrophy and identify changes in influential and sensitive downstream nodes for a pre-menopausal female, post-menopausal female, younger male, and older male condition. Our model shows how T and E2 interact with each other and other hypertrophic stimuli, with T demonstrating a more potent hypertrophic effect than E2. This model increases our understanding of the mechanisms through which sex hormones influence cardiac hypertrophy and can aid with developing more effective cardiac therapies for all patients."

Microanatomical and molecular differences in homologous neurons, those with similar locations and developmental origins across species, are best characterized in the neocortical mantle, the center of complex brain functions; however, the purpose of these differences remains unclear. We performed whole-cell microelectrode recordings along with microanatomical and molecular analyses of human fast-spiking parvalbumin (pvalb)-expressing interneurons in neocortical tissue resected during brain surgery, comparing them with similar data obtained from the mouse neocortex. The action potential (AP) firing threshold was lower in human neurons than in mouse neurons. This was due to a deficiency in low-voltage\u2013activated inhibitory Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 potassium channels in the axon initial segment (AIS), a specialized axonal region that determines AP threshold and initiation, in human cells. In contrast, Kv1 ion channels were prominent in mouse neurons. The AIS was also moderately elongated in humans. Computational simulations of fast-spiking interneurons revealed that the human-type AIS lowers the AP threshold and shortens the time lag for AP initiation. We found that the low membrane AP firing threshold in pvalb neurons is closely linked to slow membrane potential kinetics in the soma. Thus, the human AIS supports fast in\u2013fast out circuit function in human pvalb neurons, compensating for electrically slow somatic membrane responses. When formulating therapeutic strategies that involve fast-spiking neurons, it is crucial to take into account the molecular and functional species differences."

Our approach enables robust long-term analysis of several hundreds of individual neurons, allowing quantification of neuronal dynamics and representational stability over time. Using this method, we identified a key developmental transition in neuronal activity statistics, marking the emergence of arousal state modulation. Beyond this key finding, our method provides an essential tool for tracking developmental trajectories of individual neurons, which could help identify potential deviations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders."

This metric yields patterns of particulate organic carbon degradation by microorganisms through the upper mesopelagic (200\u2013500\u00a0m depth). Here, we investigate the temporal sequence of particulate organic carbon degradation in two steps. First, we intercept sinking particle assemblages from different depths (180\u2013300\u00a0m) and hence with varying degrees of exposure to microbial activity. Second, we incubate these intercepted particles shipboard for 12\u00a0h (short-term) and track degradation using apparent respiratory quotients (dDIC/dDO<sub>2</sub>). We also conducted a 12-h shipboard incubation on a particle assemblage that had already undergone a 36-h <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in situ</span> c-respire (long-term) incubation. At a subantarctic and two polar sites, apparent respiratory quotients (ARQs) from short-term incubations exhibited a significant decrease with depth, consistent with particles deeper in the upper mesopelagic being exposed to a longer period of degradation and flux attenuation (as they settle). ARQs from all long-term incubations had significantly lower ARQs, and smaller depth-dependent gradients, than the short-term incubations. We interpret these trends as being driven in part by sequential changes in the stoichiometry of the microbially altered particulate organic carbon (POC) substrates. ARQs of &lt;0.5 (less than the theoretical minimum) were observed in long-term incubations suggesting a role for incomplete oxidation of dissolved substrates.

Here, we comprehensively investigated the long-term changes in phytoplankton body size over 20\u00a0years in the coastal waters of Hong Kong through monthly sampling at 25 stations across the region. We employed a framework distinguishing two drivers of community miniaturization: (i) intraspecific size reduction (species miniaturization) and (ii) shifts in community composition toward a higher proportion of small species. At the species level, miniaturization was widespread, more in diatoms than dinoflagellates, primarily driven by temperature, supporting the temperature-size relation. In contrast, community-level miniaturization was negligible across most stations (except in a semi-closed bay), which was attributed to the decreased proportion of small species. This could be explained by the declined phosphate concentration which not only directly reduced the proportion of small species but also diminished the temperature sensitivity of phytoplankton community. Our findings provide multiscale insights into coastal phytoplankton miniaturization, with critical implications for food web dynamics and the biological carbon pump. Moreover, we highlight that anthropogenic nutrient reduction may significantly mitigate community-level phytoplankton miniaturization, though localized effects in semi-enclosed systems warrant further investigation.</span>"

Transfer methods include antibiotic treatment of recipients and colonization using either co-housing with donors or the transplantation of faecal or caecal donor material. However, the efficiency and dynamics of these methods in reconstituting recipients with donor microbes is not well understood. We thus directly compared co-housing, faecal transplantation, and caecal transplantation methods. Donor mice from Taconic Biosciences, possessing distinct microbial communities, served as the microbial source for recipient mice from Jackson Laboratories, which were treated with antibiotics to disrupt their native microbiota. We monitored bacterial and viral populations longitudinally over the course of antibiotics treatment and reconstitution using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and shotgun sequencing of viral-like particles (VLPs). As expected, antibiotic treatment rapidly depleted microbial biomass and diversity, with slow and incomplete natural recovery of the microbiota in non-transfer-recipient control mice. Although all transfer methods reconstituted recipient mice with donor microbiota, co-housing achieved this more rapidly for both bacterial and viral communities. Overall, faecal and caecal transplant resulted in highly similar colonization processes with some minor variation in enrichment for two specific bacterial families.

Due to heterogeneity, a deeper understanding of the influence of soil moisture on the dynamics of organic matter decomposition and resultant phenotypes remains a challenge. Soils from a long-term field experiment exposed to high and low moisture treatments were incubated in the laboratory to investigate organic matter decomposition using chitin as a model substrate. By combining enzymatic assays, biomass measurements, and microbial enrichment via activity-based probes, we determined the microbial functional response to chitin amendments and field moisture treatments at both the community and cell scales. Chitinolytic activities showed significant responses to the amendment of chitin, independent of differences in field moisture treatments. However, for other measurements of carbon metabolism and cellular functions, soils from high moisture field treatments had greater potential enzyme activity than soils from low moisture field treatments. A cell tagging approach was used to enrich and quantify bacterial taxa that are actively producing chitin-degrading enzymes. By integrating organism, community, and soil core measurements we show that (i) a small subset of taxa compose the majority (&gt;50%) of chitinase production despite broad functional redundancy, (ii) the identity of key chitin degraders varies with moisture level, and (iii) extracellular enzymes that are not cell-associated account for most potential chitinase activity measured in field soil.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The keystone species concept holds that certain members of an ecological community, despite their low abundance, exert disproportionately large effects on species diversity and composition. In microbial ecology, experimental validation of this concept has been limited because targeted removal of individual species remains technically challenging. Here, we developed a procedure to test the keystone species concept within a soil microbial food web by selectively suppressing a protist predator at the microscale via ultraviolet-induced phototoxicity in a microfluidic soil chip system. We targeted a hypotrich ciliate (subclass Hypotrichia), and combined microscopy with high-throughput amplicon sequencing of microbial taxonomic markers to assess, across multiple trophic levels, how its suppression affected microbial community abundance, diversity, and composition. Over the 20-day incubation, the chip system supported complex communities of bacteria, fungi, and protists. Following Hypotrichia suppression, two distinct ecological responses were observed: first, an increase in the relative abundance of flagellates, consistent with mesopredator release, accompanied by a significant rise in overall protist diversity; second, a convergence in protist community composition, indicative of biotic homogenization. Bacterial community abundance, richness, and composition remained unchanged, likely due to compensatory predation from a relative increase in bacterivorous flagellates. In contrast, fungal diversity decreased, presumably because the altered protist community favored facultative fungal consumers. Collectively, these findings provide direct experimental evidence that low-abundance microbial predators can function as keystone species, modulating predator community composition and diversity, and exerting cascading effects on lower trophic levels within microbial brown food webs.</span>"

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Microbial nitrification of fertilizers represents is a significant global source of greenhouse gas emissions. This process increases emissions, fosters toxic algal blooms, and raises crop production costs. Some plants naturally release biological nitrification inhibitors to suppress ammonium-oxidizing microbes and reduce nitrification. Engineering nitrification inhibitor production into food and bioenergy crops via synthetic biology offers a promising mitigation strategy, but its success depends on addressing gaps in our understanding of inhibitor degradation in soil. This study begins to fill this gap by identifying a previously unknown microbial pathway for degrading phenylpropanoid methyl esters, a key class of aromatic nitrification inhibitors. Using transcriptomics and high-throughput functional genomics, we discovered genes essential for phenylpropanoid methyl ester degradation. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed two novel enzymes, including a newly identified phenylpropanoid methyl esterase, that direct phenylpropanoid methyl esters into known metabolic pathways. Importantly, transferring these genes into bacteria capable of metabolizing other phenylpropanoids enabled them to use the methyl esters as a carbon source. This work provides critical insights into microbial nitrification inhibitor degradation, a poorly understood element of the nitrification cycle.</span>"

In <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">R. pedestris</span>, we further find that both priority effects and displacement mechanisms shape interspecies competition outcomes.

We examined the conservation of plant beneficial traits in bacteria associated with 10 protists of diverse lineages that were isolated from the maize rhizosphere. Metagenomics, whole-genome sequence analysis, and functional assays of 61 groups of protist-associated bacteria identified tryptophan-dependent biosynthesis of the auxin hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) as the most prevalent predicted trait.

Through an integrated metapangenomic analysis of 71 new SAR11 isolate genomes and a time-series of metagenomes from the prominent source of isolation, we reveal an ecological and phylogenetic partitioning of metabolic traits across SAR11 genera.

Although the distinction between these patterns has long held for plants and animals, microbial community dynamics can blur the line between ecological and evolutionary processes, especially as they can occur on very similar timescales.

In this review, we summarize the forces known to generate genetic diversity in bacterial genomes and describe the approaches used to study bacterial evolution from simple to more complex systems.

    "content": "Abstract\nTurbulence plays a key role in sediment mobilization in intertidal zones. Prior laboratory studies have explored turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) under the influence of waves and currents, but the extent to which an idealized laboratory setting translates to natural environments remains unclear. Key questions persist in application to field conditions, including the relative contributions of waves and currents to TKE, and the impact of vegetation flexibility. To address these gaps, this study made field observations of waves, currents, and TKE across the intertidal zone of Chongming Dongtan Wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. Hydrodynamic conditions differed between the mudflat and salt marsh, with the magnitude of current velocity exceeding wave velocity on the mud flat, but the reverse being true within the marsh. As a result of this shift, on the mudflat, TKE was mainly generated by currents, and in the marsh, TKE was mainly generated by waves. Additionally, TKE on the mudflat was associated with bed shear production, but within the salt marsh was mainly produced through the interaction between waves and vegetation. Finally, the influence of vegetation flexibility on vegetation\u2010generated TKE was described by a new model that incorporated the plant Cauchy number (Ca$$ Ca $$) and vegetation\u2010to\u2010wave\u2010excursion length ratio (L$$ L $$) as descriptors for vegetation motion. The inclusion of vegetation motion significantly improved the prediction of TKE within the salt marsh canopy, which can contribute to more accurate coastal modeling, improving coastal zone management and research."

    "content": "Abstract\nMarine mass mortality events (MMEs) are a growing source of concern globally. Affecting diverse marine ecosystems, they frequently cause significant ecological disruptions, often leading to large\u2010scale ecological shifts. However, in contrast to terrestrial MMEs, most marine mortalities likely occur undetected, particularly in cryptic and infaunal taxa. Here, we present the first documented reports of irregular echinoid mass mortalities from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea\u2014a region at the forefront of ocean warming and anthropogenic pressure. Compiling ecological, morphometric, molecular, and remote\u2010sensed environmental data, we reconstruct a 14\u2010yr history (2011\u20132024) of MMEs involving the key infaunal bioturbating echinoids of the genus Echinocardium. We analyzed environmental parameters, namely sea surface temperatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, river discharge, and wave intensity, in the weeks preceding five MMEs and analyzed skeletal remains to explore the potential drivers of mortalities. We show that these events are neither rare nor stochastic but rather recurring and spatially structured\u2014spanning hundreds of meters and positioned at the outlet of major rivers, likely driven by cumulative environmental and human stressors. By revealing patterns in taxa often overlooked in marine monitoring, this work highlights the urgency of assessing ecological stability in sedimentary ecosystems. We highlight the need for implementing long\u2010term monitoring and improved environmental assessments, at both national and regional scales, to include benthic infaunal communities\u2014particularly in rapidly warming regions like the Eastern Mediterranean."

At the manganese\u2010rich site with moderate WCH conditions, MnR and FeR dominated Corg mineralization in surface sediments, comprising up to 87% (0\u20131\u2009cm depth) and 88% (1\u20132\u2009cm depth) of Corg mineralization, respectively. In particular, the reoxidation of Fe2+ to Fe\u2010oxides coupled to abiotic MnR in the surface sediments induced P adsorption to Fe(Mn)\u2010oxides, thereby suppressing benthic P release. In contrast, at the relatively organic\u2010rich and sulfidic site with severe WCH, SR comprised up to 87% of the Corg mineralization, and enhanced HS\u2212 production stimulated benthic P release. Moreover, the impact of WCH on the anoxic sediment condition persisted longer even after the termination of WCH, implying that the spatial\u2013temporal expansion of WCH ultimately grants sulfidic sediments a role as a chronic source of P in most coastal ecosystems. Our results, combining fine\u2010scale Corg mineralization rate measurements with comprehensive geochemical inventory analysis, provide crucial information to elucidate cause\u2010effect relationships behind observed phenomena on the distributions and flux of elements in coastal environments where WCH is expanding due to climate change and excessive human activities."

    "content": "Single-cell foundational models have emerged as a powerful tool for learning generalizable cellular representations from large-scale data. Most models in this domain use transformer backbones, which require careful engineering of gene and expression encoding strategies, yet there is no consensus on which encoding techniques are effective. While benchmarking efforts up to date have focused on evaluating downstream applications using already pretrained models, we take a fundamentally different approach: we isolate different encoding paradigms and systematically compare them by training models from scratch under controlled conditions. Moreover, we scale pretraining to 10 million cells across 100 diverse datasets, a tenfold increase compared to similar studies. Through empirical experiments, we find that contrary to common assumptions, pretrained embeddings from large protein models like ESM-2 consistently underperformed task-specific learned embeddings. Our work provides clear empirical guidance for model design decisions and establishes a systematic benchmark for evaluating encoding strategies in single-cell foundational models."

    "content": "Post-transcriptional regulation by small RNAs (sRNAs) enables bacteria to fine-tune gene expression and rapidly adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. In Sphingopyxis granuli TFA, SuhB, the only sRNA characterized to date in this strain, was previously shown to repress thnR translation to control tetralin degradation under carbon catabolite repression conditions. Here, we reveal additional regulatory roles of SuhB beyond carbon metabolism. Deletion of suhB increases sensitivity to diverse abiotic stresses, including osmotic, oxidative, desiccation, and copper stress. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis indicates widespread alterations in the proteome in the absence of SuhB, affecting metabolic pathways and membrane-associated processes. Moreover, a LysR-type transcription factor mutant, identified as a direct activator of suhB, shows similar phenotypes. Together, these findings demonstrate that SuhB functions as a global post-transcriptional regulator, coordinating metabolic balance, membrane composition, and stress resistance in S. granuli TFA, highlighting the critical role of sRNA-mediated regulation in environmental bacteria."

It replicates exclusively within eukaryotic cells, inhabiting a range of host cell types in mammals and mites. Previously, we demonstrated that its extracellular, non-replicative form is developmentally distinct from the intracellular replicative form. In this study, we investigated spatial and temporal heterogeneity within the intracellular bacterial population. By quantifying bacterial DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, and subcellular localization, we defined four distinct intracellular growth stages: pre-active, lag, log, and maturation. Using microscopy-based single-cell analysis of selected transcripts and proteins, we further revealed transcriptional and translational heterogeneity within microcolonies. These findings highlight the complex, asynchronous nature of intracellular O. tsutsugamushi growth and underscore the importance of single-cell analysis in understanding its pathobiology."

    "content": "Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells respond to heat shock by engaging multiple regulatory mechanisms that preserve proteostasis, including adjustments in transcription, translation, and mRNA metabolism. Although the transcriptional response to heat stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been well characterized, the extent to which translation efficiency (TE) is remodeled and how this remodeling contributes to protein synthesis remains less understood. Here, analysis of previously published ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data revealed that in S. cerevisiae, the TE varies during heat shock, depending on both temperature and stress duration. In contrast, TE remained largely stable in Escherichia coli under comparable conditions or during activation of {sigma}32, the main regulator of heat shock response in bacteria. In yeast, TE modulation patterns correlated with changes in protein abundance and differed markedly between early and late stages of stress. At 10 min, transcripts with short 5'UTRs and high codon optimality tended to display higher TE, primarily due to the easier ribosome engagement in these transcripts. By 30 min, the TE pattern across transcripts had changed drastically, suggesting increased availability of newly synthesized stress-response transcripts. These findings support a model in which early TE adjustments depend on intrinsic mRNA properties, whereas shifts in mRNA accessibility and transcriptional output shape later changes. The results highlight TE remodeling as a dynamic component of the heat-shock response in yeast and distinguish this behavior from the more buffered response observed in bacteria."

    "content": "Successful viral infections reflect the balanced outcome of a tightly regulated program of viral gene expression and manipulation of the host cell environment to favor production of new infectious particles. The productive (lytic) replication cycle of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is dependent on the essential transcription factor ICP4 encoded by one of five immediate-early genes. At different steps in the HSV-1 temporal cascade, ICP4 either positively or negatively regulates transcription of immediate-early, early, and late HSV-1 genes, largely through sequence-specific binding to cis-acting regulatory elements. In contrast, the direct regulation of host transcription by ICP4 is less well understood. In this study we exogenously expressed doxycycline-inducible wild-type and mutant ICP4 proteins in uninfected primary human fibroblasts and performed RNA-Seq to identify ICP4-driven changes to the host transcriptome. Cross-referencing our findings to a published dataset of ICP4-dependent changes to the host transcriptome in HSV-1 infected cells provided validation for a subset of differentially-expressed genes regulated by ICP4. Furthermore, disrupting the ICP4 DNA-binding domain was sufficient to alter the cellular gene transcriptional program responsive to ICP4. This indicates that the DNA-binding domain of ICP4, which is required for site-specific DNA binding to the virus genome, may also regulate binding to the host genome. Together, these data provide a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of how wild-type and mutant ICP4 expression impact cellular gene expression in uninfected cells."

    "content": "The human gut microbiome has been increasingly recognized as a metabolic compartment that influences health and therapeutic responses. While recent studies have cataloged diverse sets of drug biotransformation reactions as a result of microbial metabolism, the pharmacological relevance of the resulting drug metabolites remains mostly uncharacterized. We investigated whether certain microbial drug metabolites can act as functional prodrugs. By systematically mining 871 putative drug metabolites produced by gut bacteria, we identified microbial drug metabolites with key physicochemical properties of prodrugs. Using bacterial culturing, a genetic gain-of-function screen coupled to mass spectrometry and comparative genomics, we uncover that Bacteroidota bacteria encode conserved methyltransferases that can generate prodrugs through carboxyl methylation. As a case in point, we demonstrate that bezafibrate gets converted to a prodrug by a distinct bacterial enzyme, increasing epithelial drug permeability in vitro and systemic drug exposure in vivo in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Additionally, we tested 170 structurally and clinically diverse drugs, and demonstrate that microbial drug-to-prodrug conversion is a common result of gut bacterial drug biotransformation. Altogether, our findings suggest a novel mechanism of how the gut microbiota influences an individual's pharmacokinetics, and may generally cause interpersonal differences in microbiota-host metabolic interactions."

    "content": "Accelerated sea-ice decline is opening the Arctic to increased shipping, elevating the risk of marine fuel spills in fragile ecosystems where extreme cold and remoteness limit cleanup options. While microbial biodegradation is the primary removal mechanism, the metabolic strategies of abundant polar taxa remain poorly understood, particularly those lacking canonical degradation genes. We characterized the hydrocarbon degradation mechanisms of Flavobacterium sp. strain R2B_3I, a psychrotolerant isolate from high Arctic beach sediments in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada. During three-month incubations with ultra low sulfur fuel oil at 4 {degrees}C, R2B_3I mounted a systems level response involving the upregulation of diverse non-canonical oxidoreductases, membrane remodeling systems, cold-shock, and oxidative stress defenses. Crucially, this strain achieved efficient degradation in the complete absence of alkB alkane hydroxylases, challenging the reliance on alkB as a universal biomarker for hydrocarbon biodegradation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct temporal shifts, linking specific gene clusters to the degradation of complex petroleum mixtures under environmentally relevant conditions. These results demonstrate that Flavobacterium, a dominant genus in polar oceans, utilize a ''cryptic'' metabolic network to process hydrocarbons, effectively bypassing the pathways typically monitored in environmental surveys. By uncovering alternative mechanisms, our study revises current models of microbial oil degradation, highlighting the overlooked potential of non-canonical degraders in determining the fate of marine fuel spills in a warming Arctic."

Here, we isolated six Candidatus Rickettsia mendelii strains from Ixodes turdus ticks in Japan. We obtained their whole-genome sequences, including one closed genome, and found that they form a distinct lineage in the AG and have the smallest genome among the known rickettsial species. Gene tree-aware reconstruction of evolutionary events using amalgamated likelihood estimation revealed that the last common ancestor of Rickettsia had a smaller gene family size than modern species do, and Ca. R. mendelii retains the most similar genomic content to this ancestral state. Various patterns of gene gain and loss among Rickettsia lineages were also suggested, highlighting their divergent evolutionary trajectories. These findings increase our understanding of Rickettsia genome evolution."

    "content": "The DNA damage (SOS) response in bacteria involves derepression of a set of genes in order to activate mechanisms to tolerate stress, repair DNA and slow down cell division. While some of these genes are well characterized, many genes exist which are clearly induced by DNA damage but for which the function is unclear. In Caulobacter crescentus, the toxin-antitoxin (TA) system higBA and a closely associated downstream transcription factor (higX) are strongly induced as part of the SOS response, but the role of higX is unknown. We show that, unexpectedly, HigX functions independently of HigBA as a cell membrane-associated regulator and is toxic when overexpressed in filamentous cells. ChIP-Seq indicated that it binds to several promoters associated with cell envelope regulation. In cells with the SOS response constitutively activated, HigX was overproduced, but at the same time was unable to bind the majority of its target promoters. higX was highly conserved in genomic context among many alpha-proteobacteria, while higBA was only found upstream of it in a small number of Caulobacter genomes, including the universal laboratory strain C. crescentus NA1000. Compositional analysis suggested that higBA originated from a foreign source, while higX is likely ancestral to the alpha-proteobacteria. Our data support a model where dysregulation of HigX production and activity in filamentous {Delta}lexA cells contributes to cell envelope instability and antibiotic sensitivity. Thus, the protective effect of inhibiting cell division during the SOS response in order to repair the DNA, carries the hidden cost of interference with HigX-mediated cell envelope maintenance."

    "content": "Agar dilution is a reference susceptibility testing method uniquely or preferentially recommended for certain antimicrobials. However, the effort required to pour individual agar plates spanning a doubling dilution range precludes its practical implementation in hospital clinical laboratories. Here, we describe an on-demand replacement for agar dilution (AD), specifically substituting poloxamer 407 (also known as Pluronic F-127) for Bacto Agar as the solidifying agent. Notably, 20% poloxamer 407 solutions (e.g., with Mueller-Hinton broth) remain liquid at refrigerated temperatures, but solidify upon warming, enabling facile set-up of poloxamer dilution testing (PD) in Petri dish or microwell format. For fosfomycin susceptibility testing, PD and reference agar dilution (AD) showed excellent categorical (CA) and essential (EA) agreement for E. coli (100% and 87%, respectively, n=31). For other Enterobacterales, excluding Klebsiella spp; CA and EA were both 82% (n=17, respectively). For P. aeruginosa, CA and EA were 60% and 100% (n=10), respectively, with the lower CA reflecting the large number of strains tested with MICs near categorical breakpoints. There were no very major errors, while major errors were only observed for Klebsiella spp. Additionally, PD substantially reduced the number of skipped dilutions 6-fold for E. coli (P < 0.0001) and inhibited swarming of Proteus species. We conclude that PD and AD, an imperfect gold standard, have essentially equivalent practical performance and that PD can therefore serve as an on-demand alternative testing methodology in clinical laboratories for fosfomycin testing of gram-negative pathogens. A broader exploration of PD's utility is thus warranted."

    "content": "Introduction - Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) and underlying cirrhosis frequently require repeated courses of antimicrobial therapy, with both the frequency and spectrum of antimicrobial exposure increasing alongside disease progression. In this population, impaired immune function and increased intestinal barrier dysfunction contribute to a heightened susceptibility of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Objective - To comprehensively characterise the gastrointestinal microbiome and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) landscape across the clinical spectrum of ACLD, and to identify microbial and resistome signatures associated with disease severity. Design - We employed long-read metagenomic sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to profile the gastrointestinal microbiome and resistome across distinct ACLD stages: acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and stable cirrhosis, compared to healthy controls. Results - ACLF patients had pronounced levels of Enterococcus faecium, with six samples out of 28 showing over 95% relative abundance, suggesting its potential as a bacterial biomarker for advanced cirrhosis. We reconstructed 28 high-quality MAGs of E. faecium from cirrhosis patients, 17 of which originated from ACLF cases. This dominance of E. faecium correlated with substantially reduced microbial diversity and a marked depletion of key commensal taxa, including Blautia, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Bifidobacterium. Resistome analysis revealed significant enrichment of clinically relevant ARGs in DC and ACLF, including those conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and glycopeptides, correlating with prior antimicrobial exposure. Conclusion - Long-read metagenomics enables high-resolution characterisation of microbial and resistome dynamics across ACLD severities. By capturing taxonomic shifts, functional potential, and ARG enrichment, this approach provides valuable insights into microbiome trajectories linked with disease severity, informing mechanistic research and potential clinical interventions."

    "content": "Wild migratory birds play a major role in the global spread of viruses, yet the diversity, host range and transmission patterns of viruses harboured by migratory species in Aotearoa/New Zealand remain largely unknown. This knowledge gap is critical given New Zealand's position along major migratory flyways spanning Oceania, Antarctica and east Asia, where understanding viral diversity is key to assessing the risk of viral introductions such as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and viral dispersal across these regions. To address this, we conducted the first large-scale metatranscriptomic survey of wild birds from New Zealand and its subantarctic islands, collecting 1,348 samples from 31 host species spanning four avian orders. We identified 118 avian viruses from 17 families, including 107 novel species, greatly expanding our knowledge of avian viral diversity. Viral communities differed significantly by host order and foraging behaviour, with scavenger birds harbouring more diverse viromes than non-scavengers. Although no HPAI subtypes were detected, we recovered a low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H1N9 virus from red knots (Calidris canutus) and a divergent tobanivirus from Auckland Island teal (Anas aucklandica), the first putative avian member of the Tobaniviridae. Notably, we detected 12 mammalian-associated viruses, primarily in scavenger birds, including Hedgehog hepatovirus, Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2, and sea lion astroviruses, with mammalian host reads confirming their dietary origin. This study establishes the first virome baseline for New Zealand's migratory birds, highlighting the ecological role of foraging in shaping viral communities and improving regional preparedness for HPAI and other emerging avian pathogens."

    "content": "Enterococcus faecalis is a common opportunistic pathogen, frequently isolated from chronic wounds, yet the mechanisms underlying its virulence and persistence in this niche remain incompletely understood. We previously showed that a subpopulation of E. faecalis can survive intracellularly for several days during murine wound infection and can replicate within macrophages, revealing an unexpected intracellular phase for this traditionally extracellular bacterium. Here, we identify the secreted metalloprotease gelatinase (GelE) and its regulator, the Fsr quorum sensing system, as key modulators of E. faecalis intracellular survival and replication. Mechanistically, Fsr quorum sensing is induced during intracellular replication, promoting GelE-dependent host cell lysis and bacterial egress. In the absence of active GelE, E. faecalis accumulates as large intracellular clusters, a phenotype observed consistently across GelE deficient wound isolates. In a mouse wound model, GelE deficient E. faecalis similarly exhibited higher intracellular numbers within wound infection-associated host cells. Together, our study uncovers GelE as a central effector that orchestrates the transition between intracellular and extracellular lifestyles of E. faecalis, providing a possible explanation for its persistence in chronic wound infection."

    "content": "RNA viruses rely on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate their genome. RdRps share a conserved core replicase structure described as a right hand within which RNA replication occurs. RNA polymerases contain a series of conserved motifs (A-G) that are essential for catalysis. Motif G, located at the RNA entry channel, guides the incoming RNA into the catalytic centre and and holds it in place during catalysis. Although RdRp phosphorylation has been reported, it has been scarcely studied. In most studied cases, phosphomimetic mutations reduced viral replication. In this study, we identified Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) polymerase (3Dpol) residues that undergo some extent of phosphorylation in infected cells. Among these residues, Thr109 and Ser110 located in motif G are highly conserved in the sequences of picornavirus polymerases and in the structure of many positive-stranded virus polymerases, including nsp12 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Using mutagenesis and reporter viruses, we show that phosphomimetic mutation of either residue abrogates viral replication, for both TMEV and SARS-CoV-2. Mutations of 3Dpol residues 109 and 110 into all other possible residues shows that, besides negatively charged phosphomimetic residues, bulky residues strongly inhibit replication, suggesting that phosphorylation inhibits polymerase activity by steric hindrance and/or through charge repulsion with RNA entering the catalytic core. Because these phosphorylatable residues are surface-exposed and conserved among viral polymerases, they represent promising targets for the rational design of broad-spectrum antiviral agents."

    "content": "The ability of morbilliviruses to infect antigen-presenting cells (APCs) plays a major role in the outcome of infection, as these cells transport the virus from the respiratory tract to the lymph nodes before spreading to lymphoid and epithelial tissues. This study used two cell models, - monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs), - from three host species (goat, sheep, cattle), to evaluate the differential ability of APCs to be infected by two strains of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) with contrasting virulence in goats. Infection was analyzed by flow cytometry, infectious titers (TCID50/mL), RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Goat and sheep MoDCs proved highly permissive to both virus strains, with viral titers at 48 hpi in the range of 104-105 TCID50/mL and a high percentage of infected cells, unlike bovine MoDCs, which were weakly infected and had no detectable viral titer, as expected for this dead-end host. In comparison, MoMs showed reduced permissiveness to PPRV in goats but not in sheep. Post-infection supernatants in goat MoMs infected with the low-virulent strain showed low or undetectable TCID50/mL, despite persistence of detectable viral genome up to 96 hpi. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed the presence of double-stranded RNA but absence of nucleoprotein of the low virulent PPRV strain in goat MoMs suggests a blockage at the level of viral protein translation. These results suggest that this combined in vitro model of MoDC and MoM infections would be useful in anticipating host susceptibility and PPRV strain virulence, providing complementary tools for PPR control efforts."

    "content": "Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, pose a concerning threat to global biodiversity, particularly to terrestrial ectotherms like insects. While lethal effects of thermal stress are widely studied, very little is known about sublethal carry-over effects of heatwaves experienced during development on adult fitness. Addressing this fundamental knowledge gap is crucial for key pollinators such as bumblebees, which face alarming population declines. Therefore, we used a highly controlled in vitro approach to expose Bombus terrestris pupae to ecologically relevant cyclic thermal stress, and studied their emergence success, subsequent adult longevity, and morphological traits. We found that cyclic thermal stress caused significant acute pupal mortality (up to 30% reduction in emergence). Most notably, this developmental stress resulted in deferred mortality, significantly reducing adult longevity (HR = 1.81) in both workers and males. Furthermore, we identified antennae and wing deformations as a powerful hazard indicator (HR = 2.50) that strongly predicts premature adult mortality. Our findings reveal that cyclic thermal stress during pupation imposes irreversible developmental damage that undermines adult physiological resilience. We argue that life-stage specific carry-over effects should be considered more in the future to avoid underestimating the long-term impact of climate change on crucial insect pollinator populations."

    "content": "Abstract\nFjord sediments are global sinks of organic carbon (OC), contributing to the long\u2010term storage of atmospheric CO2. Despite this recognition, the transfer and burial of OC in fjord sediments are still poorly quantified and suffer from a sampling bias toward distal environments where marine OC is dominant. Here we present organic geochemical data obtained on sediment samples (suspended river sediments, fjord sediment trap, surface fjord sediments, sediment core) collected in the Baker river\u2010fjord system, with a particular focus on the Baker River submarine delta, which is fed by Chile's largest river. We measured total OC contents and OC stable isotope composition to quantify the amount and type of OC (marine or terrestrial) stored in the fjord submarine delta. We find that OC fluxes are twice higher in summer (106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0g OC/m2/yr) than in winter (53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0g OC/m2/yr) due to higher sediment discharge from meltwater. Sediment trap OC fluxes are on the same order of magnitude than those in the nearby sediment core (103\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0g OC/m2/yr) during the last 35\u00a0years, suggesting rapid OC burial in sediments. Carbon isotopes suggest that the OC stored in the fjord submarine delta is predominantly of terrestrial origin. We calculate that the Baker submarine delta buries 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0kt OC/yr, which corresponds to 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011% of the estimated OC annual flux delivered by the Baker River (14.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5\u00a0kt OC/yr). Fjord deltas should thus be considered in fjord OC budgets as they could significantly raise global estimates of terrestrial OC burial in marine sediments."

Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that low-nitrogen sites had more negative connections between denitrifying and anammox communities.

    "content": "Abstract\nReservoirs with thicker sediments generally exhibit elevated carbon emissions; however, this relationship may not necessarily persist when emissions are assessed per unit thickness. A comprehensive understanding of this relationship is essential for accurately evaluating carbon emissions across various sedimentation patterns. This study proposes the concept of carbon emission intensity (CEI), defined as carbon emissions per unit mass or volume of sediment, evaluates its correlation with sediment thickness (ST) using 58 global data sets and clarifies the impact of ST on CEI through controlled incubation experiments. The results revealed a strong negative logarithmic correlation between CEI and ST (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.88), indicating that increasing ST substantially reduces CEI values. The observed trend can be attributed to the potential of thicker sediment layers to restrict oxygen penetration, promoting organic carbon (OC) burial. The incubation experiments reinforced this mechanism, revealing that although thicker sediments generated higher absolute carbon emissions, their CEI values were consistently lower. Oxygen penetration and active OC decomposition were found to be limited to the top few centimeters of sediment, independent of the total ST. The findings indicate that dam construction in narrow river sections could be strategically favorable, as these areas are more likely to accumulate thicker sediments characterized by lower CEI, reducing overall carbon emissions."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nHybridization can induce transgressive gene expression, which may often contribute to hybrid vigour or dysfunction. Nevertheless, how different cis\u2010 and trans\u2010regulatory variants between parental species influence hybrid expression novelty remains largely unknown. To decipher the detailed genetic architecture underlying this phenomenon, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping in a multi\u2010generational Nelumbo population, including parental species (N. nucifera and N. lutea), F1 hybrids and backcrossed F2 (BC1F2) individuals. Using the Matrix eQTL under an additive linear model with covariates, our analysis identified 147,872 cis\u2010eQTL and 151,632 trans\u2010eQTL SNP\u2010gene associations, which regulated the expression of 2538 cis\u2010eGenes and 4805 trans\u2010eGenes, respectively. Notably, trans\u2010eQTLs exhibit significantly stronger regulatory effects on gene expression variation than cis\u2010eQTLs. Trans\u2010eQTLs, over\u2010represented by transcription factors, such as\u00a0C2H2, MYB, FAR1, are predominant drivers of transgressive expression in hybrids, which is markedly more prevalent in segregating BC1F2 individuals. We further demonstrated that cis\u2010 and trans\u2010regulatory variants are linked to transgressive expression of crucial genes in the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (a key medicinal metabolite of Nelumbo) biosynthetic pathway. These findings collectively highlight the primary influence of trans\u2010regulatory rewiring on generating transgressive expression in hybrid populations. In conclusion, our study provides valuable genetic resources for understanding how regulatory network rewiring contributes to transcriptional variation and transgressive phenotypes in interspecific hybrids between species."

    "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.70195?af=R",
    "content": "ABSTRACT\nRiver barriers have long played a central role in diversification models of tropical regions, including the exceptionally biodiverse island Madagascar. Although their role is best understood by integrating additional factors such as elevation and the ecological niche of a species, empirical studies integrating these variables remain rare. We used restriction site\u2010associated DNA sequencing to assess the combined effect of rivers, topography, climate and forest cover on the distributions and diversity of four Microcebus and two Avahi species (Primates, Lemuriformes) in northeastern Madagascar. We inferred population structure, gene flow and genetic diversity, and assessed the association of these ecogeographic variables and genetic differentiation using isolation\u2010by\u2010resistance models. Our results show that significant differences in genetic diversity and connectivity among species can be explained by species\u2010specific responses to landscape features and phylogeographic histories. Specifically, rivers present general barriers to gene flow, but dispersal between inter\u2010river systems is possible via high\u2010elevation headwater regions. While this led to high connectivity and genetic diversity in M. lehilahytsara and A. laniger, gene flow among M. jonahi populations is limited by low climatic niche suitability at higher elevations. Moreover, the more restricted distributions of M. macarthurii, M. simmonsi and A. mooreorum likely resulted from refugial dynamics and sea level fluctuations leading to allopatric divergence and microendemism. Together, the findings illustrate how ecological differences among species and temporal landscape dynamics mediate the role of rivers as dispersal barriers. They also highlight the importance of prioritising river headwaters and topographically complex regions, which were shown to promote connectivity, in conservation efforts."

However, the consequences of this human\u2010induced downsizing of animal communities for plant\u2010frugivore trait matching\u2014the alignment between frugivory\u2010related plant traits (e.g., fruit size) and frugivore traits (e.g., body mass)\u2014remain unquantified at macroecological scales. Here, we examine how human disturbance and environmental conditions influence trait matching in tropical plant\u2010frugivore networks. We compiled fruit size data for 1927 plant species from primary sources, along with body mass and dietary information for 1120 frugivorous animal species (birds, mammals and reptiles), and integrated these with 12,708 plant\u2010frugivore interactions recorded across 102 networks. Using fourth\u2010corner analyses and structural equation models (SEMs), we quantified how human disturbance and environmental conditions directly and indirectly affected trait matching strength (fruit\u2010size\u2010to\u2010body\u2010mass correlation) across networks. SEMs revealed that human disturbance weakened trait matching by reducing the range of frugivore body masses within networks, whereas wet and productive environments promoted a higher proportion of fruit in frugivore diets, leading to stronger trait matching. Our results demonstrate that human disturbance weakens plant\u2010frugivore trait matching through the downsizing of animal communities, thereby providing a quantitative assessment of the decoupling of coevolved relationships between fruiting plants and their animal seed dispersers."

    "content": "<p>by Thomas Bonte, Oriane Pourcelot, Adham Safieddine, Floric Slimani, Florian Mueller, Dominique Weil, Edouard Bertrand, Thomas Walter</p>\n\nThe cell cycle is a series of regulated stages during which a cell grows, replicates its DNA, and divides. It consists of four phases \u2013 two growth phases (G1 and G2), a replication phase (S), and a division phase (M) \u2013 each characterized by distinct transcriptional programs and impacting most other cellular processes. In imaging assays, the cell cycle phase can be identified using specific cell-cycle markers. However, the use of dedicated cell-cycle markers can be impractical or even prohibitive, as they occupy fluorescent channels that may be needed for other reporters. To address this limitation we propose a method to infer the cell cycle phase from a widely used fluorescent reporter: SiR-DNA, thereby bypassing the need for phase-specific markers while leveraging information already present in common experimental setups. Our method is based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), enhanced with two auxiliary tasks: predicting the average intensity of phase-specific markers and enforcing temporal consistency through latent space regularization. The reconstruction task ensures that the latent space captures cell cycle\u2013relevant features, while the temporal constraint promotes biological plausibility. The resulting model, CC-VAE, classifies cell cycle phases with high accuracy from widely used DNA markers and can thus be applied to high-content screening datasets not specifically designed for cell cycle analysis. CC-VAE is freely available, along with a new, publicly released dataset comprising over 600,000 labeled HeLa Kyoto nuclear images to support further development and benchmarking in the community."

    "content": "<p>by Eui Min Jeong, Chang Yoon Chung, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>\n\nUltrasensitive transcriptional switches are essential for converting gradual molecular inputs into decisive gene expression responses, enabling critical behaviors such as bistability and oscillations. While cooperative binding, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, has been classically regarded as a key ultrasensitivity mechanism, recent theoretical works have demonstrated that combinations of indirect repression mechanisms\u2014sequestration, blocking, and displacement\u2014can also achieve ultrasensitive switches with greater robustness to transcriptional noise. However, these previous works have neglected key biological constraints such as DNA binding kinetics and the limited availability of transcriptional activators, raising the question of whether ultrasensitivity and noise robustness can be sustained under biologically realistic conditions. Here, we systematically assess the impact of these factors on ultrasensitivity and noise robustness under physiologically plausible conditions. We show that while various repression combinations can reduce noise, only the full combination of all three indirect mechanisms consistently maintains low noise and high ultrasensitivity. As a result, biological oscillators employing this triple repression architecture retain precise rhythmic switching even under high noise, and even when activators are shared across thousands of target genes. Our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these repression mechanisms in natural gene regulatory systems."

    "content": "<p>by Andrew C. Matthews, Sonja Lehtinen, Tatiana Dimitriu</p>\n\nConjugative plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are critical for the spread of AMR, due to their ability to transmit horizontally between bacterial hosts. We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible <i>Escherichia coli</i> hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of streamlined plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. A simple model of plasmid competition further shows that any horizontal or vertical transmission advantage conferred by plasmid streamlining would be enough to drive the displacement of competing AMR plasmids, with a given horizontal transmission advantage leading to faster replacement in conditions favoring horizontal transmission. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution or engineered streamlined plasmids could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria."

Toews</p>\n\nIntrogression between species has the potential to shape evolutionary trajectories in important ways, but uncovering complex introgression dynamics has only recently been made possible by advances in genomics. Warblers of the avian family Parulidae exemplify rapid diversification and sexual trait divergence, and we endeavored to study historical introgression in the family. We sequenced multiple genomes of nearly every species, constructed a phylogeny for the family, and investigated gene flow across the genome and at genes known for controlling feather color. We found that DNA haplotypes including the gene <i>BCO2</i>, which encodes an enzyme that degrades yellow carotenoids, have spread among genera multiple times\u2014from <i>Vermivora</i> to <i>Geothlypis</i> and from <i>Leiothlypis</i> to multiple <i>Cardellina</i> and <i>Setophaga</i> species. Patterns of inheritance in the latter case point to introgression that occurred 0.5 to 2 million years ago, and the shared haplotype among recipient species is less than 100 nucleotides long. Separately, we found evidence of introgression from red <i>Cardellina</i> species to both of the two red <i>Myioborus</i> species at <i>BDH1L</i> and from one red <i>Myioborus</i> species to the other at <i>CYP2J19</i>; both are key genes in the pathway that converts yellow carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids. Our results show that introgression is a common mechanism for the evolution of colorful plumage in parulid warblers and hint at complex histories of gene flow behind some of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s most colorful birds."

    "content": "<p>by Qiu C. Wu, Aishwarya Swaminathan, Ashley Winward, Logan Lalonde, Yung Hwang, Noah Littman, Merav Socolovsky, Allon M. Klein</p>\n\nRed blood cell production is regulated by erythropoietin (Epo), maintaining tissue oxygen tension in the steady state and in response to stress. To date, only a handful of factors other than Epo are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, limiting therapeutic options. We recently found that IL-17, a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, interacts synergistically with Epo to increase formation of erythroid colonies <i>in vitro</i>. Here, we administered IL-17 to mice to determine whether it accelerates erythropoiesis <i>in vivo</i>. We found that while IL-17 alone had little effect on erythroid and other hematopoietic lineages, combined treatment with both IL-17 and Epo generated a specific and strong synergistic response in erythroid progenitors that significantly increased erythropoietic rate. IL-17 administration also accelerated the erythropoietic response of mice to hypoxia. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that IL-17 acts by sensitizing erythroid progenitors to Epo, rather than through a distinct transcriptional response. Using a dynamical model, we propose that this mechanism optimizes conflicting requirements in the regulation of erythropoiesis, balancing the need for low-cost maintenance of the steady state, with a sufficiently fast stress response. Further, our findings suggest a potentially broadly applicable mechanism whereby pleiotropic cytokines are able to exert lineage-specific effects when their actions are dependent on synergism with lineage-specific factors."

    "content": "Recent studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of the immune cell compartment within the steady-state murine and human CNS. However, it is not known whether this diversity is conserved among non-mammalian vertebrates, especially in the zebrafish, a model system with increasing translational value. Here, we reveal the complexity of the immune landscape of the adult zebrafish brain. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized these different immune cell subpopulations, including cell types that have not been or have only been partially characterized in zebrafish so far. By histology, we found that, despite microglia being the main immune cell type in the parenchyma, the zebrafish brain is also populated by a distinct myeloid population that shares a gene signature with mammalian dendritic cells (DC). Notably, zebrafish DC-like cells rely on <i>batf3</i>, a gene essential for the development of conventional DC1 in the mouse. Using specific fluorescent reporter lines that allowed us to reliably discriminate DC-like cells from microglia, we quantified brain myeloid cell defects in commonly used <i>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></i>, <i>csf1ra<sup>-/-</sup></i>, and <i>csf1rb<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutant fish, revealing previously unappreciated distinct microglia and DC-like phenotypes. Overall, our results suggest a conserved heterogeneity of brain immune cells across vertebrate evolution and also highlights zebrafish-specific brain immunity characteristics."

Our results reveal that frequent storms contribute to a cumulative cooling of Tm, primarily through anomalous meridional Ekman heat transport.

    "content": "Abstract\nChina's Spring Festival, with consistent \u223c30% NOx (NO\u00a0+\u00a0NO2) reductions annually, provides a natural experiment to investigate oxidant response to emission reductions. Unlike isolated events such as the COVID\u201019 lockdown, the Spring Festivals offer a more robust decade\u2010long (2015\u20132024) data set. Analysis of these observations reveals a striking shift in oxidant (Ox\u00a0=\u00a0O3\u00a0+\u00a0NO2) response from negative to positive values over time despite similar emission reduction patterns each year. Chemical transport modeling indicates that meteorological factors are the primary drivers of these variations. Machine learning analysis further identifies cloud cover and radiation changes as controlling factors, with strong correlations between \u0394Ox and meteorological parameters (R\u00a0=\u00a00.85\u20130.94) across all regions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about emission control effectiveness, showing that meteorological variability overrides expected chemical responses.

The inferred spatial scale and propagation direction are likely shaped by the interplay between wind\u2010driven Ekman transport and shoreline constraints. These findings demonstrate that Earth's rotation can exert a dynamically significant influence even in medium\u2010sized lakes (~\u200910\u201315\u2009km), where the basin scale approaches the local Rossby radius. The observed enhancement of \u03b5 below the thermocline suggests that near\u2010inertial waves can effectively transmit energy into deeper layers, contributing to vertical mixing and the redistribution of nutrients and biogeochemical tracers during the early summer stratification period."

    "content": "Abstract\nWe present the biogeochemical cycling of dissolved zinc (dZn) in marginal and open waters of the Indian Ocean using a high\u2010resolution dataset collected during multiple GEOTRACES\u2010India (GI) cruises. Atmospheric dust deposition is a minor source compared to continental shelf inputs for dZn in photic waters of the northern Indian Ocean. A strong linear relationship between dZn and silicate (Si) is noted across the Indian Ocean, with lower slope ratios (dZn\u2009:\u2009Si) in the Arabian Sea (0.045\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001\u2009nM\u2009\u03bcM\u22121) and Bay of Bengal (0.049\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001\u2009nM\u2009\u03bcM\u22121) relative to the southern tropical Indian Ocean (STIO, 0.062\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002\u2009nM\u2009\u03bcM\u22121). We investigated these regional differences using an inverse modeling approach by quantifying the fractional contribution of each water mass to the measured dZn concentrations in the water column. Our results indicate that water mass mixing and scavenging are the primary mechanisms controlling dZn distribution in the region. Scavenging of dZn in the intermediate waters is likely driving the lower dZn\u2010Si regression slopes in the northern Indian Ocean. Intense scavenging may result from zinc sulfide formation in anoxic microenvironments of poorly ventilated waters or adsorption onto sinking particles. Dissolved Zn in excess of its preformed component is nearly twice as high in deep waters of the northern Indian Ocean compared to the STIO, suggesting desorption of previously scavenged Zn and/or presence of regional deep sources. These findings advance our understanding of regional zinc cycling in the Indian Ocean."

    "content": "Abstract\nTemperature is a critical environmental variable for ecosystem processes, since metabolic rates of organisms increase with temperature, which could potentially elevate their excretion rates. In a warming climate, it is imperative to understand how temperature influences consumers' nutrient excretion, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Here, we review, quantify and synthesize the effect sizes of temperature on nutrient excretion rates of freshwater fishes through a meta\u2010analysis. Because there are too few studies measuring fish P excretion under different temperatures, we could only test the temperature effect on N excretion rates. Overall, our results show that fish N excretion increases with temperature, but there is considerable variability between studies. We investigated the nature of this heterogeneity by testing the influence of fish body size, climate (tropical, subtropical, temperate), delta temperature (difference between the lowest and highest temperature used in the experiment), acclimatization time, and feeding status (being fed or starved before excretion measurements) as moderators (predictors in meta\u2010analysis). We found that delta temperature and feeding status significantly influenced the magnitude of the effect, with studies applying the highest delta temperatures, and studies with starved fish, showing the highest effect sizes. Our meta\u2010analysis suggests that the magnitude of temperature increase and food availability can partly determine how global warming will affect fishes' N excretion in freshwater ecosystems."

We demonstrate that NetDes predicts regulatory interactions and reproduces gene expression dynamics through benchmarking using in-silico time trajectories with decoys, tests on gene circuit simulations of embryonic phenotypic switching, and application to time-series scRNA-seq data from human iPSC differentiation. Compared to existing approaches, NetDes has the advantage of capturing sequential state transitions within a single dynamical model. Network simulations and coarse-graining further elucidate the regulatory roles of genes and their combinations in driving these transitions. Our approach provides a generalizable framework for mechanistic modeling of gene regulation in complex cell state transitions."

    "content": "Beyond the heterologous expression of genes to generate microbes with novel properties, evolutionary engineering offers a complementary approach by exploiting adaptive processes to refine and expand cellular functionalities in biotechnology. A promising source for the generation of novel metabolic functions is the so-called underground metabolism, i.e., the subnetwork conformed by catalytically inefficient promiscuous enzymatic activities without an apparent physiological role. In this work, the potential of this underground metabolism as a source of novel phenotypes has been assessed in the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440. To accomplish this, the high-quality genome-scale metabolic model iJN1462 was updated and expanded by the known set of promiscuous activities in this organism. The new metabolic space was explored to detect latent metabolic traits that could emerge through adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) in order to broaden the range of available nutrients for P. putida. Using ALE, strains capable to degrade N-acetyl-L-alanine, an overproduced metabolite in HIV patients, were obtained. A multidisciplinary characterization of these evolved strains revealed that adaptation arose through synergistic and additive effects involving modifications in enzymes and transcription factors. This work demonstrates how underground metabolism can be exploited to expand the metabolic versatility of P. putida."

To understand the contribution of both basal (tonic) and induced interferon (IFN) to antiviral defences in a physiologically relevant system, we established air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary human bronchial epithelium (HBE) and small airway epithelium (HSE). Via an organoid intermediate stage, the limited healthy donor material was expanded while preserving stemness and subsequently differentiated. Characterisation by spatial and transcriptomic analyses showed that the cellular diversity and architecture of our ALI cultures were comparable to native human lung epithelium. Upon infection with relevant human respiratory pathogens, such as Human Rhinovirus (HRV16) and human Coronaviruses (229E and NL63), only HRV16 induced a strong and early type I and III IFN response, leading to its eventual clearance from the cultures. Depletion of tonic type I/III IFNs using neutralising antibodies or scavengers reduced expression of levels of IFN-stimulated genes and increased infectious HRV production by ~7-10-fold. Taken together, we present a method for generating primary lung epithelial cultures that retain their IFN status, demonstrate clearance of HRV by innate defences, and highlight the importance of tonic IFN in early antiviral defences."

    "content": "Low-copy-number plasmids often rely on dedicated maintenance mechanisms, such as partitioning systems, to ensure stable inheritance across generations. These partition systems actively segregate sister plasmid copies during cell division and are classified by the NTPase types they encode. While the distribution and organization of partition system types are well characterized in Enterobacteriaceae plasmids, their functions and diversity across broader bacterial taxa remain poorly understood. Here, we analyze a large and diverse plasmid database to examine the distribution of partition system types and find that plasmids encoding multiple partition systems are more common than previously recognized. Notably, many plasmids encode multiple partition systems of the same type, an organization that has not been previously investigated. To further investigate, we employ the Streptomyces linear plasmid SCP1, which encodes two type I ATP- and CTP-dependent parABS partition systems, as a model. Sequence analysis shows that both SCP1-encoded ParBs harbor less conserved CTPase domains than their chromosomal counterparts, suggesting they might diverge from canonical ParB functions. However, using chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing, biochemical assays, and targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that both proteins are bona fide ParB CTPase proteins: they recognize distinct parS sites on SCP1, bind and hydrolyze CTP, and slide to accumulate on DNA. Despite both systems being functional, only parABS1, but not parABS2, is crucial for SCP1 maintenance under standard laboratory conditions. Altogether, these findings provide the first functional characterization of dual ParB-CTPase partition systems coexisting on a single plasmid, advancing our understanding of plasmid maintenance in Streptomyces, and reveal new aspects of the diversity and distribution of plasmid partition systems in bacteria."

Further expanding this platform for the bioproduction of value-added compounds (power-to-x) has the potential to increase the economic viability of such processes. This requires a genetic toolset that enables the controlled expression of recombinant pathways. Here, we report the fully autotrophic inducible recombinant bioproduction of acetoin from H2 and CO2 in Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus {Delta}H. To facilitate inducible gene expression, we implemented an anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible promoter system, expanding our available set of promoters. The aTc-inducible system enabled controlled expression of a codon-optimized acetoin-production operon comprising the acetolactate synthase- and acetolactate decarboxylase-encoding genes from Streptococcus thermophilus. Batch cultivation at 42{degrees}C demonstrated aTc-dependent acetoin formation, yielding up to 0.45 {+/-} 0.08 mM acetoin. Fed-batch bioreactor experiments confirmed growth-coupled, recombinant acetoin production, while eliminating the non-specific acetoin accumulation that we observed during non-growth phases in batch cultivation. Continuous cultivation in a chemostat resulted in stable acetoin production rates of 1.28 {+/-} 0.07 mol L-1 h-1 at 42{degrees}C. Elevated temperatures led to reduced acetoin production, suggesting diminished activity or thermal instability of the heterologous enzymes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of value-added bioproduction in Methanothermobacter and establishes an inducible expression system suitable for pathway engineering in thermophilic methanogens. Together with genome-scale modeling and emerging enzyme engineering strategies, these results lay the foundation for developing robust, CH4-co-producing power-to-x bioprocesses with Methanothermobacter species."

Using this Genotype by Environment by Rhizosphere Microbiome (GERMs) model, we studied three cereal genotypes: two inbred maize lines with contrasting heat sensitivity, and a sorghum inbred that displayed moderate heat tolerance. Plants were grown under optimal and heat stressed conditions across two soil treatments. We developed a systems-level metatranscriptomics approach to examine both plant and microbial transcriptomic profiles and integrated them with microbiome compositional data and plant phenotypes. We compared our strategy to amplicon profiling and found that our metatranscriptomic strategy offers greater functional and taxonomic resolution, allowing us to characterize active microbial pathways and analyze them jointly with plant gene expression profiles within a single system. We show that the microbiome functional profile is driven by host genotype and environmental factors and can enhance plant resilience. Our analyses identified plant genes and microbial pathways consistently associated with heat tolerance and key host-microbe interactions. Specifically, we identified D-amino acid metabolism as a plausible mechanism underlying a synergistic response to heat stress. These results demonstrate that the rhizosphere microbiome is not a passive component but an active participant in plant responses to abiotic stress. This work offers a new perspective on cereal adaptation to high temperatures and underscores the utility of the GERMs framework for dissecting functional relationships among plant genotype, environment, and the rhizosphere microbiome."

We characterize PhrA1.2, the second most prevalent PhrA pheromone, as a non-signaling variant found in the globally distributed GPSC6 lineage, with presence in isolates dating back to the 1960s. In GPSC6, PhrA1.2 co-occurs with TprA1.2, a truncated transcriptional regulator carrying premature stop codons that eliminate the predicted pheromone-binding domain. Functional assays show that PhrA1.2 is non-functional, both when paired with the truncated TprA1.2 and when paired with the canonical regulator allele TprA1.1. Unexpectedly, despite its truncation, TprA1.2 activates genes involved in oxidative stress responses, including those related to iron-sulfur cluster formation and redox homeostasis. Loss of tprA1.2 impairs growth and increases hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, while in vivo experiments reveal a fitness defect during nasopharyngeal colonization. Together, our findings show that the TprA1.2 allele represents a regulator that has lost its communication component while modifying its regulon. This variant promotes adaptation to oxidative stress and contributes to colonization, demonstrating circuit rewiring of a peptide-regulator CCC system in an epidemiologically relevant S. pneumoniae lineage."

    "content": "Bacterial growth and respiration are fundamental metabolic processes that affect how energy is used and impact carbon sequestration at the ecosystem scale. However, these traits are usually quantified independently, growth is quantified with endpoint biomass measurements while respiration is quantified by monitoring oxygen or carbon dioxide. Because the two physiological traits are collected at different temporal and volumetric scales (hours-to-days for growth versus minutes-to-hours for respiration), reconciling them is challenging and often introduces scale-mismatch bias, obscuring causal links between metabolism and environmental drivers. In this study, we develop a novel method for quantifying the rates of bacterial growth and respiration concurrently from a single dissolved oxygen time series. Our approach introduces a model that couples exponential biomass growth with biomass-specific respiration, enabling the simultaneous inference of both rates in real time. We applied our high throughput method to 15 bacterial strains isolated from natural environments. Our approach yielded growth estimates in close agreement with measurements based on popular methods using optical density or flow cytometry with no evidence of taxon-specific bias. We also tested our approach in quantifying the effects of temperature on respiration, growth and carbon use-efficiency in Pseudomonas sp. Our method yielded typical unimodal thermal response curves for growth and respiration where rates were highest at moderate temperatures, while carbon-use efficiency increased from cooler temperatures, peaked around the thermal optimum, and declined at high temperature. By quantifying respiration and growth simultaneously and in high throughput, our approach effectively enables measurement of microbial metabolic strategies and adaptations to stress. It offers a non-invasive and scalable tool for high throughput phenotyping and studies of environmental perturbations, enabling a new class of trait-based microbial ecology that links cellular physiology to broader ecosystem function."

The human upper respiratory tract is co-colonized by commensal and pathogenic streptococci, but how CCC systems mediate their interactions remains unclear. Here, we investigated the TprA/PhrA quorum-sensing system, composed of the transcription factor TprA and its cognate signaling peptide PhrA, across Streptococcus mitis and S. pneumoniae. Comparative genomics showed that this system is broadly distributed across both species, with most strains sharing identical phrA alleles that enable interspecies signaling. In both species, the tprA/phrA module is commonly linked to the streptococcin E (sce) locus, encoding a putative bacteriocin. We show that activation of the sce operon enhances the competitive fitness of S. mitis in biofilm and infection models. In S. mitis strain C22, two diverse copies of tprA/phrA are present and differentially regulated, coordinating expression of tprA/phrA and the downstream sce locus through both shared and independent pathways. Transcriptomic analyses revealed redundancy, additivity, and cross-regulation between the two systems, linking them to the control of bacteriocin production, competence, and oxidative stress responses. Distinct promoter architectures and TprA-binding motifs underlie the functional divergence of these paralogues, highlighting how regulatory diversification can expand quorum-sensing outputs.

Here, we investigated the metabolic basis enabling the efficient assimilation of PE oxidised scission products and its prevalence in microbial communities naturally colonising plastic surfaces. Metabolomic profiling of weathered PE (W-PE) leachates revealed a highly diverse pool of oxidised aliphatic compounds varying in chain length and oxidation state. Different plastic-degrading bacteria consumed this complex mix of metabolites to distinct extents, with consumption efficiency positively correlating with the number of redundant genes associated with the {beta}-oxidation pathway in their genomes. Comparative proteomic analysis of two Alcanivorax species exhibiting contrasting PE-leachate consumption capabilities confirmed that this functional redundancy was fully activated in response to the chemically complex PE-derived substrate pool. In contrast, it remained largely uninduced in the presence of the single, structurally simple alkane hexadecane. Hence, our results indicate that efficient PE assimilation requires a broad and redundant enzymatic repertoire capable of funnelling structurally diverse oxidised aliphatic intermediates through {beta}-oxidation. Metagenomic analysis of plastisphere communities further revealed enrichment of fatty acid degradation genes in biofilms colonising both pristine and W-PE--as expected more strongly in W-PE--compared with wood and surrounding water controls, supporting the ecological relevance of this mechanism for PE biodegradation. Together, these findings identify {beta}-oxidation metabolic redundancy as a key trait underpinning microbial PE assimilation and suggest that plastic degradation may be occurring under natural environmental conditions."

    "content": "A key bottleneck in microbiome engineering is ensuring the long-term host association of introduced microbes. Selecting probiotic candidates based on evolutionary genomic decay signatures of host dependency offers a potential solution. The Ruegeria strain B4 of the population MC10, identified by such signatures, has shown persistent colonization in corals. To understand the putative mechanisms behind this, we characterized its functional profile using an integrated multi-omics approach, comparing it to non-candidate Ruegeria strains isolated from the same coral colony and compartment (mucus). This controlled for host genotype and microenvironment, both of which influence colonization outcomes. We show that MC10's genome is uniquely enriched for host-interaction functions, such as siderophore-mediated iron acquisition and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, which were confirmed phenotypically by enhanced siderophore production and biofilm formation. Subsequent proteomic analysis showed that the MC10-B4 proteome underwent a \"motility-to-sessility\" reprogramming upon exposure to host metabolites, a response distinct from its non-candidate sympatric relatives. Our findings suggest an evolutionary shift toward host dependency, marked by genomic decay on one hand and compensated by the gain and expression of functions that enable stable colonization on the other. MC10's functional profile, particularly its sensitivity to oxidative stress, would likely have excluded it from conventional probiotic screens that prioritize robust in vitro performance. This validates an evolution-guided approach that prioritizes innate colonization potential over pre-defined in vitro functionalities, informing the rational design of next-generation probiotics."

    "content": "Cold seeps are globally distributed deep-sea ecosystems hosting diverse chemosynthetic microbiomes, yet their viral communities remain poorly characterized. Here, we establish the Global Cold Seep Virome (GCSV), a comprehensive catalog of 193,465 species-level viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) and over five million viral proteins reconstructed from 314 short- and long-read metagenomes across 18 seep sites. More than 99% of vOTUs are unique relative to existing environmental viromes, revealing an exceptionally novel viral reservoir shaped by low microdiversity and strong purifying selection. Host prediction and phylogenomics uncover a disproportionately rich archaeoviral component, including extensive viral lineages associated with Halobacteriota, Asgardarchaeota, and DPANN archaea. Structure-based annotation of 2.56 million viral protein clusters reveals pervasive viral dark matter and ecologically specialized hallmark genes, including hydrophilic and flexible major capsid proteins and terminases potentially adapted to deep-sea pressure and temperature. We identified 7,154 auxiliary metabolic genes linked to carbon fixation, methane oxidation, alkane degradation, and sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus transformations, suggesting that viruses modulate key pathways underlying seep biogeochemistry. Cold seep viruses also encode a broad anti-defense repertoire targeting diverse prokaryotic immunity systems, with functional assays confirming potent antagonism of Thoeris, Gabija, and CBASS defenses. Finally, we predicted 15,710 viral lysins, including experimentally validated enzymes with strong antibacterial activity and structurally novel domain architectures. Overall, the newly discovered viral diversity in cold seeps broadens our understanding of viral contributions to ecosystem function and microbial metabolism, and offers a rich repertoire of viral proteins for future mechanistic studies and biotechnological applications."

    "content": "Macroinvertebrates are a critical source of food for riverine fishes. Anthropogenic stressors can transform riverine macroinvertebrate communities, yet the consequences of such transformations to the fishes that feed on them are poorly understood. Changes in any combination of food 'abundance', 'accessibility' or 'quality' may be referred to as changes in the 'foodscape' of fishes. Stressor-driven increases of inaccessible prey that are difficult for fish to detect, capture or ingest, may render foodscapes less profitable to fishes. We examined how nutrient enrichment, fine sediment, acid mine drainage (AMD), flooding and drying reshape fish foodscapes by altering the accessibility of macroinvertebrate prey for two New Zealand river fishes, Galaxias vulgaris and Gobiomorphus breviceps. We determined relative accessibility of macroinvertebrate taxa and traits to these fishes by comparing the abundance of prey taxa and traits in the environment with their corresponding abundances in fish diets. To make these comparisons, invertebrate and fish gut samples were collected from the same river reaches, at the same times, over three years. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of fish gut contents facilitated efficient diet characterisation of over 700 fish guts. Finally, to determine how multiple stressors might affect fish foodscapes, we related invertebrate trait-specific accessibilities to published data defining how the composition of those macroinvertebrate traits varies along stressor gradients. Macroinvertebrate traits that were most accessible to fishes were those promoting detection (e.g., active foraging behaviours exhibited by 'crawlers' and 'scrapers') and ingestion (e.g., moderate size, morphologies lacking defensive structures), typical of mayfly and free-living caddisfly larvae. In contrast, prey with traits inhibiting detection (e.g., small size and burrowing behaviour) and ingestion by gape-limited fishes (e.g., large size), were less accessible to the fishes we studied. Trait abundance-stressor relationships revealed that that increasing fine sediment, nutrients, AMD and drying, and decreased flooding frequency, favoured macroinvertebrates with traits that erode accessibility to fishes. These results show that multiple stressors may decrease the profitability of fish foodscapes by filtering out macroinvertebrate prey with traits promoting accessibility to fishes. Food web approaches to understanding multi-stressor impacts are rare, but are necessary to understand how the effects of multiple stressors on primary consumers then go on to affect predators of higher trophic position. A major barrier to fish foodscape research is the difficulty and cost of estimating trophic networks. We discuss how eDNA metabarcoding, coupled with trait-based approaches may help overcome these barriers, enabling generalisable assessments of foodscape changes caused by multiple stressors."

Both environments exert selective pressures on rhizobia, influencing the reproductive success of individual strains (e.g., fitness). The soil, a heterogeneous and fluctuating environment, is often overlooked, and little is known about whether selection in the soil influences the outcomes of the rhizobia-legume mutualism. We exposed a mixture of 68 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains to eight soil treatments (temperature, osmotic, and texture perturbations) and selection by two Medicago plant hosts. We found that cold (4{degrees}C) and warm (32{degrees}C) temperatures, as well as salt addition, had the strongest effects on diversity, community composition, or population size. Strain relative fitness was strongly positively correlated among soil treatments, except for cold. Genome-wide association analysis revealed a complex genetic architecture for soil fitness. In contrast, when comparing rhizobial fitness between soil and host environments, we found minimal strain fitness correlations, suggesting independent genetic bases and habitat-specific adaptations. Lastly, by examining the relationship between rhizobial fitness in the soil and their nitrogen-fixing plant benefits, we found that soil selection influenced the relative abundance of high- and low-quality strains; However, whether these effects were positive or negative for the plant was host dependent. Our results suggest that rhizobial evolution in soil and host are largely independent, but soil selection can alter mutualism benefits."

    "content": "Plant-associated microbiomes play significant roles in determining their host' responses to stress, which is increasingly common in a rapidly changing world. For example, foliar endophytes can increase tolerance to drought and decrease herbivory. Global atmospheric changes, such as increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), have the potential to directly and indirectly alter microbiome community structure in ways that affect host plants underscoring our need to understand how microbial communities in planta will change under global change. Here, we used a metabarcoding approach to assess community composition and network structure of bacterial and fungal phyllosphere microbiomes within soybean (Glycine max) exposed to ambient and elevated [CO2] in the field. We found that fungal community composition differed between soybean grown in elevated and ambient [CO2], while bacterial communities did not. Additionally, co-occurrence networks for both fungi and bacteria in elevated [CO2] exhibited marked changes compared to the ambient networks including the composition of hub taxa. Overall, our findings suggest that anthropogenic change, such as elevated [CO2], can cause profound shifts in community assembly of microbes within their plant hosts. Our findings may aid those developing agro-ecological strategies using microbes to improve crop traits, which necessitates understanding the drivers of microbiome community structure."

    "content": "Pest control often causes high mortality, reducing population density but enabling recovery when survivors are freed from intraspecific competition and density dependent demographic rates. Understanding these demographic responses is critical for effective management, especially when life stages differ in the harm they cause. We evaluated mortality-based management of intermediate copepod hosts to control Guinea worm (GW) transmission, combining mathematical models with a population dynamics experiment designed to mimic current pesticide control methods across a range of intensities. Despite initial reductions in density, copepods recovered so rapidly that control appeared to fail, enabled by extremely fast maturation rates in low-density populations. However, model simulations of GW transmission showed that although total and stage-specific densities rebounded, infectious adult copepods, the proximate cause of infections, were strongly suppressed, indicating cryptic success. Ultimately, this study highlights the importance of understanding mechanisms of density dependence when designing and optimizing pest control interventions."

    "content": "Invasive rodents are major contributors to biodiversity loss, particularly on islands where native species have evolved in their absence, rendering them vulnerable to predation. Genetic biocontrol offers a promising suite of species-specific technologies that may contribute to rodent suppression and elimination. Here, we evaluate the potential of Y-linked genome editors (YLEs), which contain a nuclease that disrupts a female-essential fertility or viability gene, to suppress or eliminate a mouse population on a small, isolated island. We benchmark YLEs against other self-limiting genetic biocontrol tools, such as sterile male releases, and self-sustaining tools, such as population suppression gene drives and Y-linked X chromosome-shredders. We use the MouseGD simulation framework to model the inheritance patterns of these systems in the context of rodent life history, calculating elimination probabilities, times to elimination and other outcomes for a range of construct designs, fitness costs and release schemes. We find that YLEs are more efficient than other self-limiting tools, and are capable of achieving rodent elimination within a short timeframe for modest release sizes. For a mouse population size of 10,000, elimination is predicted within five years for releases of 350 males per month, and within ten years for releases of 150 males per month. This scale of production is well within existing capabilities, potentially enabling suppression to encompass a larger spatial scale. We found that elimination could be achieved for YLEs targeting both haploinsufficient and haplosufficient target genes; but for a more restrictive parameter space for the haplosufficient case. Gene drives were predicted to achieve suppression and elimination for smaller release sizes; but also to spread to non-target populations. In contrast, YLEs do not bias inheritance and hence display minimal spillover. Altogether, these characteristics present YLEs as a promising, ecologically-manageable biocontrol tool for elimination of invasive rodents and conservation of native species."

Microorganisms largely drive the production and degradation of hydrocarbons, yet little is known about viral contributions to hydrocarbon degradation. Here we identified 786 viral contigs from IMG/VR(v4), encoding five aerobic (alkB, ladA, almA, ndoB and dszC) and three anaerobic (bssA, ebdA and abcA) hydrocarbon-degrading genes (HDGs). vOTUs encoding HDGs span 26 distinct viral families, including 249 are mainly associated with host-associated environment and 463 are derived from aquatic habitat, respectively, implying that these viruses are broadly engaged in hydrocarbon-degradation processes across the entire biosphere. alkB (35%) and almA (28%) was tended to be encoded by Schizomimiviridae, bssA was tended to be encoded by T5-like bacteriophages (29%) and SPO1-like bacteriophages (22%), suggesting that the carriage of HDGs by viruses exhibits taxonomic specificity. With respect to host associations, Pseudomonadota and Bacillota constitute the two main potential host lineages, associated with 268 and 71 vOTUs, respectively. The profiling of ecological footprint reveals that viruses contribute a total of up to 30% gene abundance and 32% transcribing activity to hydrocarbon degradation in the global ocean. This study systematically revealed the distribution, diversity, virus-host correlation and activity of virus-encoded HDGs, underscoring the significant role of viruses in hydrocarbon metabolism on a global scale."

    "content": "Pervasive human activities have led to the extirpation of predator species in many ecosystems. Understanding the extent and mechanisms by which such predator loss influences prey behaviour is critical for predicting the ecological consequences of trophic downgrading. We investigated reef fish behaviour in response to predator presence within and outside a protected area in the South Andaman Islands, India. We used 3D printed models to simulate the presence of two different types of predators; a sit-and-wait predator, a grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea) and a wide-ranging pursuit predator, a barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda). We recorded foraging, vigilance, and movement behaviours of herbivorous and invertivorous fish encountered in each plot. Overall, we found that fish were significantly more vigilant in response to both predator models compared to a non-predator control within protected areas but not outside protected areas. Foraging behaviour was suppressed by the predator treatments; however, herbivorous and invertivorous fish responded differently within protected areas. Fish movement behaviours also differed across predator treatments, prey foraging guilds, and areas. Anti-predator responses are thus highly contingent on habitat and both predator and prey traits. We highlight how the selective removal of predators by humans alters predation risk for prey and hence their risk-sensitive behaviours."

While foraging, dispersal, and migration are the most widely studied movement types, they operate at distinct spatial and temporal scales, and no single resource currently integrates these processes across taxa, traits, and ecosystems. We present MacroMove, a comprehensive global movement database containing 92,207 observations from 4,329 (4,167 using GBIF backbone) species, spanning 36 classes and 648 families across 205 countries, with data sourced from 6,234 references and 36 meta-analyses/databases. It includes both vertebrates and invertebrates from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. The database includes various movement metrics - home range area, dispersal distance, migration distance, day range, routine speed and maximum speed - including summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, maximum) where available. Records are reported at individual, population, or species levels and include standardised metadata describing species identity (binomial name, class, family), research methods (e.g. sampling method, sampling level and sampling dates) and location (e.g. country, location and coordinates). The dataset was assembled from published meta-analyses/databases and original studies included in these meta-analyses. Trait information (body mass and locomotion mode) from original studies and associated metadata was incorporated, with additional data sourced from established trait databases and reputable online resources. In the final dataset, body mass is available for 98 % and locomotion for 100% of species. Taxonomy was harmonised using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) backbone taxonomy. The database is supplied in comma-delimited text (.csv) format to maximise accessibility and compatibility with a wide range of workflows. By consolidating existing movement data into a single, standardised and openly accessible resource, MacroMove fills a major gap in available biodiversity data. It serves as a practical and extensible foundation for synthesising movement information across taxa and ecosystems, advancing data-driven research on the ecological and evolutionary correlates of animal movement."

Truffles have become a promising source of new compounds because they contain a wide range of biologically active ingredients.

The aim of this study was to study the antibiotic and growth stimulating effects of methanolic extracts of truffle fruiting bodies collected in Russia in 2020-2022. The extracts demonstrated inhibitory activity against St. carnosus, E. persicina, and kanamycin-resistant E. coli. Also, for the first time, we have demonstrated that truffle extracts have biological activity in terms of stimulating the growth of C. vulgaris. We have observed the effects of short-term and long-term growth stimulation.

We extend this method to the case of two-sexes and to time-variant demographic rates. Drawing from the mathematical tools of Fourier and convolution theory as well as basic probability and matrix algebra, we derive closed form expressions which capture the recursive nature of kin replenishment, generation-by-generation. Formulae presented here extend arbitrary genealogical distances to recover relatives considered in the leading frameworks of kinship. All we require as inputs are age, sex, and time-specific mortality and fertility schedules. This research presents the first kinship model able to predict the probable numbers of relatives, structured by age and sex within a time-varying demography. As well as producing the probable numbers of living kin, the model flexibly extends to give the probable numbers of deaths an individual experiences. Such a detailed analysis of the kin-network will be useful in many fields."

With the use of satellite observations, we demonstrate that there are errors in the time of day that clouds are occurring in ESMs that would cause bias in shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) that is greater than 45% of the total SWCRE bias, but such errors in the cloud diurnal cycle are masked by other compensating errors, indicating that these ESMs are getting the right answer for the wrong reasons.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

This homogeneous sensor is based on a self-assembled DNA nanosphere loaded with tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). The sensor operates in an \u201coff-on\u201d mode, in which bacterium-aptamer binding triggers a conformational change in the DNA nanosphere, releasing TCPP and generating an enhanced ECL signal. The inclusion of cerium nanoparticles boosts signal intensity through electrocatalytic reactions, improving sensitivity with a detection limit of \u2264100\u00a0colony-forming units per milliliter. Integrated with a microfluidic chip, the system enables multibacterial detection in just 45\u00a0minutes.

Ferroptosis, a newly recognized form of regulated cell death, contributes critically to SCI pathology, and targeting this process may enhance neuronal survival. Extracellular vesicles, key mediators of intercellular communication, are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for central nervous system injury. Here, we examined the role of athlete-derived plasma extracellular vesicles (AEVs) in neuronal ferroptosis and motor function recovery after SCI. In a murine model, AEVs markedly inhibited ferroptosis and improved motor outcomes. Mechanistically, AEVs delivered RNF216, which promoted ubiquitination and degradation of NOX1, thereby reducing ferroptotic damage and facilitating recovery. Moreover, RNF216-enriched vesicles enhanced synaptic plasticity, supporting neuronal regeneration and network reestablishment. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized RNF216-NOX1 axis in SCI and highlight AEVs as a previously unidentified therapeutic strategy.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Here, we use in vitro\u2013generated ECM bioscaffolds that recapitulate cell-ECM interactions and induce broad metabolic alterations in PDAC cells. High-throughput integration of multiomics datasets coupled with metabolic tracing showed that the ECM enhances the generation of guanylates in PDAC cells, the accumulation of which alleviates oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage, and boosts PDAC cell proliferation. These events are guided by the guanosine monophosphate (GMP)\u2013producing enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), the expression of which correlated with that of matrisomal and DNA repair genes in samples from patients with PDAC.

    "content": "Abstract\nRain, fog, and dew can all provide the conditions necessary to induce direct uptake of water into the foliage of plants. Although grasslands are known to have frequent leaf\u2010wetting events, the capacity of grasses to conduct foliar water uptake (FWU) is not well understood. Here, we show the results of greenhouse experiments used to quantify FWU during leaf wetting and under a range of drought conditions. Over a 2\u00a0week dry down in which irrigation was withheld, a 40% decrease in FWU was observed. In a separate experiment, we quantified FWU capacity using an established submergence method and attempted to relate this to leaf traits such as stomatal density and leaf hydrophobicity. Across the species tested, we found an average FWU of 3.67 \u00b1 $\\pm $ 0.32 (mg H2 ${\\mathrm{H}}_{2}$O cm\u22122 ${\\text{cm}}^{-2}$) which represented a leaf water content increase of 9.25 \u00b1 $\\pm $ 0.95% over a 3\u00a0hr leaf wetting treatment. We were not able to establish a statistically significant relationship between FWU capacity and the hypothesized leaf traits drivers, but stomatal conductance showed partial control on uptake. Our results indicate that FWU occurs in C3 ${C}_{3}$ perennial grasses and may provide some relief during drought. However, we found that the benefits resulting from FWU decrease as drought becomes severe. We conclude with a recommendation for further research into the mechanistic drivers of FWU capacity in C3 ${C}_{3}$ perennial grasses."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe extent of projected ocean acidification is partly dependent on the natural variability of marine carbonate chemistry\u2014which is higher in coastal systems than in the open ocean. However, there are limited empirical studies quantifying the rate, magnitude and drivers of coastal environmental variability, preventing accurate assessments for how species and their associated communities may respond to projected climate change. Here, we quantified the annual variability of pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen in a coralline algae reef, a globally distributed biodiverse habitat that may be one of the most sensitive to projected climate change. We found that coralline algae and their communities are exposed to pH values as low as those projected for 2100 (even under a low emission scenario) for 63% of the year, including most of autumn and all of winter. Annual fluctuations in pH ranged by 0.46 units, with identifiable patterns at diel to seasonal timescales driven by various biogeochemical factors. Biologically driven patterns in dissolved oxygen and pH were coupled at multiple periodicities, and temperature was coupled to pH during the winter. Tidal cycling additionally modulated biological forcing of pH, increasing the complexity of intra\u2010seasonal pH variability. Forecasting this environmental variability to the future led to projections of new pH extremes well beyond all IPCC emission scenarios. However, persistent long\u2010term exposure to low pH may increase the acclimation and adaptation potential of coralline algae and their associated communities, providing a level of optimism for the continued survival of this habitat despite sensitivity to projected climate change."

Soil samples were collected from skid trails (DIST) and from adjacent, not\u2010trafficked areas (UND) to assess bulk density, penetration resistance, shear strength, organic matter content, and the QBS\u2010ar index of microarthropod biodiversity. Logging machinery significantly compacted the soil in DIST_NEW, increasing bulk density by 19% compared with UND_NEW. Penetration resistance tripled (0.26 vs. 0.09\u00a0MPa in CON), and shear strength rose from 1.96 to 7.18\u00a0t\u00a0m\u22122. The QBS\u2010ar index declined by 50% in comparison to the CON areas, indicating substantial biodiversity loss. After 5\u00a0years, partial recovery was observed in DIST_OLD, with bulk density and penetration resistance decreasing by 13% and 8%, respectively, though values remained above those in CON sites. These results highlight the lasting impacts of forest operations on soil health and microarthropod biodiversity. To reduce degradation, strategies such as permanent skid trail planning or use of protective technologies like logging mats are recommended. Continued research into deeper soil layers and various soil types is essential to guide more sustainable forest management practices."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study evaluates the tsunami generation potential and scaling characteristics of rotational submarine landslides along the eastern margin of the Sea of Japan, where many submarine active faults and fine\u2010grained sediments are distributed. These landslides pose significant tsunami hazards, but their locations and magnitudes are difficult to predict, making them a major source of uncertainty in tsunami hazard assessments. We identified landslide traces using high\u2010resolution bathymetric data, estimated landslide volumes, and applied an established empirical formula to calculate initial tsunami amplitudes. The initial tsunami amplitudes calculated using the empirical formula were validated against numerical simulations using a two\u2010layer model. Several potential tsunami sources were identified with initial amplitudes exceeding 10\u00a0m, all located in shallow waters on the continental shelf and characterized by thick landslide deposits. A clear power\u2010law relationship was observed between landslide area and volume, consistent with previous studies of rotational slides. The volume\u2013frequency relationship also followed a power\u2010law, in contrast to the logarithmic trends typically associated with flow\u2010type landslides. Spatial analysis revealed that landslide events with significant tsunami impact often clustered near submarine active faults, suggesting strong ground motion as a primary trigger. The consistency between empirical and numerical estimates supports the validity of the empirical formula for rotational landslide tsunamis. These findings demonstrate the value of failure mode\u2010specific scaling analysis and source characterization for improving quantitative tsunami hazard assessments. The results may contribute to probabilistic hazard analysis, such as Monte Carlo simulations, and support coastal disaster prevention planning."

    "content": "Abstract\nNares Strait is an important export pathway of sea ice, where its transport is highly intermittent due to the formation and collapse of sea ice arches. The islands in the strait, especially Hans Island, contribute to heightened collision forces between distinct ice floes and the land. However, since even state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art large\u2010scale models remain relatively coarse and use continuous sea ice rheology, the complexities of floe\u2010scale sea ice interactions with small islands in the Nares Strait have not been much explored. Here, we use a novel discrete element model, SubZero, to identify the role of small islands in affecting intense summer\u2010time sea ice transport in the Nares Strait. We show that SubZero can reproduce crucial sea ice characteristics, including observed area transport, intermittency of area fluxes, and floe size distribution (FSD) derived from satellite imagery. We find that the intermittency of sea ice fluxes relates to the power\u2010law exponent of the simulated FSD, and matching it to observations implies that the floe strength for fracturing must be inversely proportional to the square root of its length scale. Conducting sensitivity simulations with modified coastlines, we identified several islands as crucial pinning points that suppress sea ice transport and cause jamming, especially during low\u2010to moderate\u2010wind conditions. The momentum budget reveals the islands slow down sea ice through direct normal contact with colliding floes and by increasing tangential drag forces from lateral coastal boundaries. Our study emphasizes floe\u2010scale interactions with islands and other coastlines in large\u2010scale sea ice transport through narrow straits."

    "content": "We introduce the range\u2010resident logistic model, an extension of the spatial logistic model that incorporates empirically supported range\u2010resident movement, showing that neglecting range residency can lead to under\u2010 or overestimating population carrying capacity. We also present a crowding index for moving organisms that is estimable from tracking data and captures the influence of spatial structure on population size, serving as a robust predictor of abundance.\n\nABSTRACT\nIndividual movement is critical in shaping population dynamics. However, existing frameworks linking these two processes often rely on unrealistic assumptions or numerical simulations. To address this gap, we introduce the range\u2010resident logistic model, an easy\u2010to\u2010simulate and mathematically tractable extension of the spatial logistic model that incorporates empirically supported range\u2010resident movement. Our framework unifies non\u2010spatial and (sessile) spatial formulations of the logistic model as limiting cases. Between these regimes, the long\u2010term population size depends nonlinearly on home\u2010range size and spatial distribution. Neglecting range residency can hence lead to under\u2010 or overestimating population carrying capacity. To better understand these results, we also introduce a novel crowding index that depends on movement parameters and can be estimated from tracking data. This index captures the influence of spatial structure on population size, and serves as a robust predictor of abundance. The range\u2010resident logistic model is thus a unifying framework bridging movement and population ecology."

By combining FEF transcriptomics with seedling dynamics in a subtropical forest, we tested whether FEF molecular functions regulate seedling survival via host fitness differences and niche differentiation under modern coexistence theory. We found that FEF transcript diversity was strongly associated with host divergence time and maximum height, and FEF functions significantly enhanced seedling survival through fitness\u2010related and niche\u2010related processes. Among these FEF functions, gene ontology (GO) terms with high host\u2010phylogeny dependence enhance seedling survival through fitness differences associated with multi\u2010organism interactions, while those with high host\u2010trait dependence enhance seedling survival through niche differentiation related to basic life processes.

    "content": "Functional diversity of zooplankton declined sharply with increasing eutrophication in hypereutrophic fishponds, despite stable species richness. Community assembly shifted from competition to habitat filtering, leading to functional homogenization (redundancy) and altered interactions among functional guilds. Ponds with total phosphorus below 300\u2009\u03bcg/L maintained higher taxonomic diversity with early signs of disrupted functional diversity, ecosystem functioning, and stability.\n\nABSTRACT\nFreshwater species are facing massive declines, often driven by eutrophication. Identifying which facets of biodiversity are sensitive is crucial, as species loss does not always translate to reduced ecosystem functioning and functional diversity. We examined how assembly rules shape zooplankton functional diversity in hypereutrophic fishponds. Higher eutrophication was hypothesised to cause functional homogenization through reduced functional diversity, habitat filtering, and trait convergence. Higher eutrophication indeed reduced functional diversity metrics, whereas species richness was kept stable. Functional richness, dispersion, and dissimilarity shifted from limiting similarity, where niche partitioning and competition shape community structure, to random (incidence data) and habitat filtering (biomass) with increasing eutrophication. Functional divergence transitioned from random to habitat filtering, whereas redundancy increased at higher trophic states. Trait convergence was the dominant process, with the environment selecting species with similar traits. Biodiversity assessments and managers should consider how functional diversity and ecosystem functions respond to anthropogenic and environmental changes."

    "content": "Janzen's climate variability hypothesis explains the variation in freshwater insects' ability to tolerate a wide range of temperatures (or thermal breadth). Neither current average temperatures nor diel temperature variation appears to alter the thermal breadth of these insects.\n\nABSTRACT\nThermal breadth (Tbr) is a critical trait influencing organisms' response to climate change. Three hypotheses seek to explain interspecific and interpopulation variation in Tbr, each relying on a different temperature driver: Climate Variability Hypothesis (CVH)\u2013annual temperature range; Thermal Constraints Hypothesis (TCH)\u2013mean annual temperature; and Diel Narrowing Hypothesis (DNH)\u2013mean diel temperature range. We test these hypotheses by measuring the Tbr of freshwater insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) along elevational gradients in the Americas and Australia, contrasting warm and cool adapted species from low climate variability tropical regions and high climate variability temperate regions. We find strong and consistent support for the CVH, limited support for the TCH (in two of four regions) and no support for the DNH. We conclude that Tbr of freshwater insects is better explained by annual temperature variability, rather than high temperatures or diel temperature variability."

    "content": "We assessed the ability of five carnivore species, that vary in body mass by nearly an order of magnitude, to act as secondary dispersers of mycorrhizal fungal spores. Overall, 67% of carnivore scats contained spores encompassing at least 32 fungal taxa (all with high spore loads) and that were dispersed an average of 0.8\u20133.5\u2009km depending on the carnivore species. We found that carnivore body mass and subsequent differences in diets and movement resulted in a dispersal effectiveness continuum with smaller\u2010bodied carnivores consuming more small mammals and dispersing higher spore loads but over shorter distances relative to larger\u2010bodied carnivores that consumed fewer small mammals but moved longer distances. Our study reveals an overlooked role that trophic interactions play in contributing to long\u2010distance dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi.\n\nABSTRACT\nPrimary dispersers of seeds and spores play critical roles in structuring the distributions of species, yet the role of predators as secondary dispersers remains largely unknown. This is especially true of mycorrhizal fungi, which often rely on small mammals to consume and disperse spores. We investigated how predator size, diet, and movement influence secondary spore dispersal in a terrestrial carnivore community by quantifying spore loads in scats (dispersal quantity) and integrating movement rates with gut passage time to determine dispersal distance (dispersal quality). Spores in carnivore scats increased with consumption of small mammals and transport of spores closely tracked home range movements. Larger carnivores deposited fewer spores but moved them farther from their source, creating a continuum between the quantity and quality of dispersal effectiveness. Our findings highlight the importance of carnivores as long\u2010distance dispersers of mycorrhizal fungi and reveal how trophic interactions contribute to ecosystem functioning through secondary dispersal."

    "content": "The role of soil nutrients in regulating tree growth and forest productivity remains uncertain. We show that in lowland tropical forests, the aboveground wood productivity of canopy\u2010exposed trees increases with soil phosphorus and potassium availability, whereas understory trees exhibit reduced productivity due to intensified size\u2010asymmetric competition. However, when averaged across canopy layers, there is no clear relationship between soil nutrients and productivity, highlighting the importance of fine\u2010scale heterogeneity and canopy stratification in understanding tropical forest dynamics.\n\nABSTRACT\nUnderstanding the drivers of aboveground wood productivity (AWP) in tropical forests is crucial for explaining ecosystem functioning and predicting their responses to environmental change. While climatic water availability is a well\u2010established driver, the role of soil nutrients and their interaction with other resources remains uncertain. We investigated how soil nutrients and light interactions shape AWP in lowland tropical forests using fine\u2010scale soil and tree (\u2265\u20091\u2009cm DBH) data from 15 large forest plots. Canopy\u2010exposed trees are nutrient\u2010limited, with AWP increasing more with phosphorus (P) than with potassium (K), indicating P's greater role in plant growth and productivity. Conversely, understory AWP declined in fertile areas, likely due to intensified size\u2010asymmetric competition. At the population level (mean across canopy layers), no relationship between soil nutrients and AWP emerged because contrasting responses among layers offset any overall association. Our results suggest that fine\u2010scale heterogeneity and canopy stratification drive nutrient effects on tropical forest productivity."

The NEURON software is commonly used to create biophysical simulations of nerve fibers, often in the outdated HOC language. Whether written in HOC or Python, implementing fiber simulations involves a steep learning curve and requires a large amount of standard, boilerplate code that is typically written anew for each project. There is a need for a code package that standardizes and simplifies the creation of model fibers, the execution of simulations of electrical stimulation, and the analysis of the resulting data. We created PyFibers, a NEURON-Python package that provides tools for accomplishing all these tasks and supports the development of new fiber models and stimulation protocols. PyFibers includes 11 fiber models from prior publications under a shared framework, and we validated each model\u2019s implementation in PyFibers against the original results. Our open-source tool simplifies and standardizes computational modeling of peripheral nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation, providing a platform for the development of novel therapies using electrical stimulation, block, and recording."

Pazour</p>\n\nVariants in the protein kinase CDKL5 cause CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), a severe neurodevelopmental condition characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The <i>Chlamydomonas</i> homolog of CDKL5, LF5, is a flagellar protein whose loss leads to elongated flagella. Here, we combine live-cell imaging, immunofluorescence, and biochemical approaches including mass spectrometry to define how CDKL5 activity is regulated and how its loss alters ciliary function. We find that <i>Chlamydomonas</i> CDKL5 is activated by LF2, a cyclin-dependent kinase, through phosphorylation of its activation loop. This activation controls CDKL5 localization in steady-state cilia, down-regulates its IFT-mediated transport as flagella reach steady-state, controls ciliary abundance of IFT proteins, and controls phosphorylation of the tubulin-binding domain of IFT74, thereby influencing flagellar length. Mouse Cdkl5 shows similar properties: it localizes within cilia, its loss leads to ciliary elongation, and its localization depends on both its kinase activity and Cdk20, the mammalian ortholog of LF2. These results extend our understanding of ciliary length control, challenge the prevailing model that CDKL5 is activated by autophosphorylation, and suggest that CDD pathogenesis arises, at least in part, from disruption of this conserved ciliary regulatory pathway."

Wyres</p>\n\nThe <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> species complex inhabits a wide variety of hosts and environments, and is a major cause of antimicrobial resistant infections. Genomics has revealed the population comprises multiple species/sub-species and hundreds of distinct co-circulating sub-lineage (SLs) that are associated with distinct gene complements. A substantial fraction of the pan-genome is predicted to be involved in metabolic functions and hence these data are consistent with metabolic differentiation at the SL level. However, this has so far remained unsubstantiated because in the past it was not possible to explore metabolic variation at scale. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics and high-throughput genome-scale metabolic modeling to systematically explore metabolic diversity across the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species complex (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20097,835 genomes). We simulated growth outcomes for each isolate using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20091,278 conditions per isolate). We showed that the distributions of metabolic genes and growth capabilities are structured in the population, and confirmed that SLs exhibit unique metabolic profiles. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated reciprocal commensalistic cross-feeding between SLs, effectively extending the range of conditions supporting individual growth. We propose that these substrate specializations may promote the existence and persistence of co-circulating SLs by reducing nutrient competition and facilitating commensal interactions. Our findings have implications for understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and for the design of novel strategies to prevent opportunistic infections caused by this World Health Organization priority antimicrobial resistant pathogen."

In this context, hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte transdifferentiation (HCT) has been ascribed with pro-regenerative functions in animal models and is a feature of end-stage human chronic liver diseases. While dampened activities of hepatocyte identity transcription factors (TFs) underlay HCT, how the cholangiocyte transcriptional program is implemented is poorly defined. Here, we identify that HCT does not involve transitioning through a hepatoblast-like transcriptional program. Furthermore, we show that HCT primarily involves induction of the archetypal transcriptional program of monopolarized epithelial cells initially repressed in hepatocytes. Indeed, HCT requires relieving H3K27me3-mediated and polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of epithelial TF encoding genes including <i>Grainyhead Like Transcription Factor 2</i> (<i>GRHL2</i>). Ectopic expression of GRHL2 in hepatocytes, including in vivo in the adult mouse liver, induces epithelial genes reminiscent of those activated during HCT. Finally, GRHL2 is detected in human hepatocytes undergoing HCT as evidenced using samples from end-stage chronic liver diseases. Hence, HCT is a process chiefly characterized by induction of a conventional epithelial transcriptional program originally lacking in hepatocytes promoted by derepression of the master epithelial TF GRHL2."

Here, using high throughput and classical genetic approaches, we performed a comparative analysis of sporulation in the human pathogen <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. A transposon-sequencing screen identified >150 genes required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. As anticipated, many of the genes that are critical for sporulation in <i>B. subtilis</i> were also required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. However, we identified >50 genes that are important for sporulation in <i>B. anthracis</i> but not in <i>B. subtilis,</i> and 22 <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation genes that are absent from the <i>B. subtilis</i> genome. To validate the hits from our screen, we generated an ordered transposon-mutant library using Knockout Sudoku. Cytological analysis of a subset of the canonical sporulation-defective mutants revealed similar but not identical phenotypes in the pathogen compared to the model. We investigated several of the newly identified sporulation genes, with an in-depth analysis of one, ORF <i>04167</i>, renamed <i>ipdA</i>. Sporulating cells lacking <i>ipdA</i> are blocked in the morphological process of engulfment, generating septal bulges. An AlphaFold-Multimer screen and a classical genetic enrichment revealed that IpdA is a secreted inhibitor of the polysaccharide deacetylase PdaN. Our data support a model in which induction of IpdA at the onset of sporulation inhibits deacetylation of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG), enabling the sporulation-specific PG hydrolases to catalyze engulfment. Altogether, our studies reveal that <i>B. subtilis</i> is an excellent model for endospore formation in <i>B. anthracis</i>, while underscoring the importance of direct analysis in <i>B. anthracis</i>. The suite of tools that we have generated will catalyze the molecular dissection of sporulation and other cell biological processes in this important human pathogen."

Patients displayed marked resting force biases at each location, even when the arm was supported. However, these biases did not transfer to arm-supported planar reaching movements; rather, abnormal resting forces only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings suggest that moving and holding are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, resting biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal movement synergies, in line with a shared mechanism. This appears to contradict the functional separation of moving and holding observed in the same patients. To resolve this paradox, we propose a conceptual model that predicts a breakdown in this functional separation when patients move without weight support. This conceptual model posits that synergies are the manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled."

    "content": "Valence, the quality by which something is perceived as good or bad, appetitive or aversive, is a fundamental building block of emotional experience and a primary driver of adaptive behavior. Pavlovian fear and reward learning paradigms are widely used in preclinical research to probe mechanisms of valence learning but with limited consideration of sex as a biological variable despite known sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired valence. Here, we compare appetitive-only, aversive-only and mixed-valence cue-outcome Pavlovian conditioning paradigms in male and female mice to dissociate effects of context, valence and salience in a sex-specific manner. Using a data-driven approach to identify behaviors indicative of valence learning in an unbiased manner, we compare task performance between paradigms in male and female mice. We show that while male and female mice acquire appetitive and aversive associations in both single- and mixed-valence paradigms, sex differences emerge in single-valence paradigms. Ultimately, we show that these apparent sex differences in valence learning are driven by non-specific baseline differences in exploratory behavior. Males explore more at baseline, altering their trajectory of cue-reward association acquisition whereas females explore less at baseline, increasing shock facilitated freezing in aversive-only contexts, masking cue discrimination. Overall, our findings illustrate how task design differentially impacts behavioral expression in male and female mice and demonstrate that mixed-valence paradigms afford a more accurate assessment of valence learning in both sexes."

    "content": "Network neuroscience has proven essential for understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain (dys)function and cognition. In this context, whole-brain network modeling\u2014also known as virtual brain modeling\u2014combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node) with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales associated with neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations, taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms, enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings. Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data. VBI shows potential to improve hypothesis evaluation in network neuroscience through uncertainty quantification and contribute to advances in precision medicine by enhancing the predictive power of virtual brain models."

    "content": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The early life assembly of the rumen microbiome is a critical process with lasting implications for host development and function. Using high-resolution longitudinal metagenomics in calves tracked from birth to three years (\u223c800\u00a0days) of age, we reconstructed 2873 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes, including 517 novel genomes primarily detected in early life. These novel genomes, spanning 274 genera and largely classified as non-core taxa, reveal a diverse and functionally distinct auxiliary microbiome. Unlike in other ecosystems, this early microbial community persists into adulthood, retaining ecological and functional relevance despite a decline in abundance. Temporal clustering revealed strong associations between auxiliary taxa and dietary transitions, with functional enrichments in environmental sensing, nutrient biosynthesis, and volatile fatty acid metabolism. Metabolic network analyses showed that auxiliary genomes complement non-auxiliary community members in key functions, with potential effects on the host. Our findings suggest that early colonizers act as ecosystem engineers, with the potential to shape the developmental trajectory of the rumen microbiome. This study thus positions the early microbiome not as a transient feature of colonization, but as a structured, functionally coherent auxiliary community that interacts with the mature rumen ecosystem.</span>"

    "content": "Dynamic gene expression pulses enable adaptive response to stimuli and can be generated in natural and synthetic systems. Controlling these dynamics typically involves circuits consisting of multiple genes and transcription factors (TFs). Here, we discover a new class of bifunctional transcriptional effector domains that can first activate and subsequently repress the same gene, producing dynamic gene expression pulses from a single input. These pulse dynamics arise from distinct, temporally separated chromatin states defined by active and repressive chromatin modifications. The balance between active and repressed states is determined by the DNA occupancy of the bifunctional TF. Bifunctional domains activate at low occupancy but switch to repression at high occupancy, resulting in a non-monotonic TF input-gene expression output relationship tunable by TF concentration and number of DNA binding sites. We develop a kinetic model that links TF occupancy to gene expression transitions, allowing for the programming of eight distinct cell \"states\" - combinations of On/Off states of 3 reporter genes - using a single bifunctional effector. This work establishes the theoretical framework and molecular mechanisms of pulse-generating gene regulation by bifunctional domains and creates a foundation for engineering complex multi-gene circuits."

    "content": "Climate change is a major driver of global biodiversity loss, and Europe is no exception with several areas exposed to high climate velocity and/or magnitude. Within the rapidly warming Europe, Italy is facing particularly high risk as part of the Mediterranean region with potentially dramatic consequences for its diverse habitat types. While species-level effects of climate risk are widely investigated, habitat-level exposure to climate change has rarely been assessed. This reduces the comprehensiveness of habitat state assessment under the Habitats Directive, and risks creating a blind spot on Protected Area effectiveness. Here we quantified the future (year 2050) climatic exposure of 139 EUNIS level-3 habitats across Italy, using two complementary metrics: analog velocity and multivariate magnitude. We found that median analog velocity was generally modest (median = 0.15; Std = 0.41 km/y), and only a few habitats exceeded the critical velocity threshold of 0.5 km/yr. Instead, magnitude was typically high (median = 6.54; Std = 0.80) and 77% of habitat exceeded the critical threshold of 6.18. We also found a few habitats (2.15%) concurrently facing high velocity and high magnitude of climate change, mainly located in Apulia and Veneto. Mediterranean annual-rich dry grasslands and montane unvegetated inland shores were among the most exposed habitats (magnitudes {approx} 7.1 - 7.3; velocities {approx} 0.42 - 0.66 km/y), while cliff and mountain forest habitats in Sardinia and Sicily showed the lowest exposure. We urge countries to explicitly incorporate habitat-level exposure as part of national protection and restoration plans."

Using single-cell approaches, we found that members of the activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factor were implicated in IFNL1 expression predisposition. This guided us to investigate the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), in IFNL1 production. We found that inhibition of JNK signaling severely altered the nature of the innate antiviral response upon pIC stimulation, independently of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Together, our study emphasizes the influence of intrinsic stochasticity in cell state on heterogeneity in IFN expression."

    "content": "Inaccuracies in metabolite cross-mapping frequently introduce errors into genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). A key challenge lies in distinguishing truly identical metabolites from closely related structural variants, such as stereoisomers, across biochemical databases. StereoMapper addresses this issue by establishing stereochemically aware relationships that clarify metabolite identity. It operates entirely on structural information, using molecular structures to infer equivalence and define relationships. StereoMapper was implemented using RDKit (2025.3.3) and Open Babel-wheel (3.1.1.22) which provides the core functionality of the Open Babel software, and benchmarked across four curated control datasets to evaluate performance in relationship classification (enantiomer, diastereomer, stereo-resolution pairs, and protomer). The pipeline was subsequently applied to 1.3 million molecular structures from multiple metabolic databases to generate equivalent isomeric sets (groups of structures identified as equivalent by StereoMapper). These sets were compared against the human subset of MetaNetX, a context-aware reference, to assess concordance and investigate disagreements. On curated positive control sets containing only positive examples across multiple relationship classes, StereoMapper achieved mean precision, recall, and F1-scores of 92.6, 98.0, and 95.3, respectively; following optimisation, these improved to 98.9, 98.2, and 98.5. Application to the 1.3 million structures produced over 339,000 stereochemically defined relationships between molecular structures. Comparison with the human subset of MetaNetX assignments showed an overall grouping concordance of 93.5%. The remaining 6.5% of differences were mainly associated with protomer relationships (52.3%) and stereo-resolution pairs (37.4%), while 21.6% involved complex or ambiguous cases."

    "content": "Developmental transitions occur in the life cycles of all multicellular organisms. Despite their fundamental relevance, the underlying dynamics remain poorly understood. In plants, floral transition is a key developmental process whereby the shoot apical meristem changes from producing leaves to flowers. Using quantitative imaging, developmental genetics and dynamical systems theory, we show that a time-dependent bistable switch between APETALA2, a key floral inhibitor, and the floral activators SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 and FRUITFULL, can explain the dynamics of floral transition in Arabidopsis. Notably, we detect a slowing down of the inhibitor dynamics, consistent with having a system crossing a critical point of a bistable switch and transiently experiencing a ghost attractor. We demonstrate that only this time-dependent bistability can generate the range of dynamical behaviours measured across genotypes, including oscillations in the inhibitor. We propose that time-dependent bistability is a robust dynamical mechanism for regulating developmental transitions."

Its potential as a therapeutic target is exemplified by its dysregulation in many disease states such as Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. ZIKV poses a significant burden to human health and hijacks autophagy to disrupt development. Here, we develop an experimental and computational pipeline to dissect ZIKV hijacking of autophagy in live cells. We build on our previously developed high-throughput scalable image-based profiling approach applied to small molecule perturbation of autophagy. In this study, we expand and modify the image-based profiling pipeline to observe autophagy and virus infection side-by-side using ZIKV encoding a fluorescent reporter. We observe cell and autophagy morphology changes after ZIKV infection and found distinct feature profiles in both infected and uninfected cells treated with ZIKV. We compare ZIKV-infected morphologies to those of cells treated with autophagy-regulating drugs and find ZIKV-induced changes similar to treatment with a combination of autophagy inducer and inhibitor. Using the pipeline, we also train and build a deep learning classifier to identify infected cells using a cellular autophagy reporter without the help of a fluorescent reporter virus. This shows the versatility of image-based profiling in infection-based systems."

Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) using metal porphyrins is of interest, but the activity of heme-mimetic gallium porphyrins against structured biofilms has not been well defined. In this study, we evaluated a newly synthesized cationic heme-mimetic gallium porphyrin (GaCHP-2-3) activated with visible light against biofilms formed by ESKAPE representatives under static and flow conditions and on titanium surface. Light-activated GaCHP-2-3 reduced biofilm viable counts by up to 4 log10 CFU/mL. Prolonged serial passaging of planktonic bacteria in the presence of GaCHP-2-3 for 20 passages did not yield increases in MIC, indicating no detectable resistance development under these conditions. This work presents GaCHP-2-3 aPDI as a candidate approach for biofilm control and treatment of infections where antibiotic resistance limits the option."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.11.693634v1?rss=1",
    "content": "Background: Trypanosomatids are parasitic flagellates best known for human pathogens causing sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis. RNA viruses infecting these protists have recently gained attention for their role in disease severity. While numerous such viruses have been described in Leishmania and several other trypanosomatid genera, none have previously been documented in the iconic genus Trypanosoma. Results: We report the first discovery and molecular characterization of RNA viruses in trypanosomes, identifying a leishmaniavirus and two narnaviruses in a single strain of Trypanosoma platydactyli, a parasite of the common wall gecko. The leishmaniavirus genome revealed a conserved organization, including a putative ribosomal frameshift site and a hairpin-like secondary structure typical of the genus. Phylogenetic inference indicates that it is closely related to leishmaniaviruses from Old World Leishmania spp., consistent with shared vector ecology. The two narnaviruses have distinct origins, although both cluster with viruses of other trypanosomatids, suggesting historical exchanges among co-infecting parasites. Conclusions: Our study expands both the known diversity of RNA viruses in trypanosomatids and the range of trypanosomatid genera that host these viruses, providing guidance for future screening. We suggest that vector ecology, particularly feeding behavior, may influence viral acquisition by trypanosomes, explaining the previous absence of viral reports from intensively studied trypanosomes of medical relevance vectored by tsetse flies or kissing bugs. Therefore, overlooked species transmitted by Nematocera represent promising candidates for future viral discovery. This concept extends beyond trypanosomatids, providing a general framework for understanding the conditions that permit viral host switching by viruses among microeukaryotes."

    "content": "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the causative agent of mpox disease in humans. The virus is comprised of two clades, Central African clade I and West African clade II with case fatality rates of ~11 and ~4%, respectively. Since the discovery of mpox disease in 1970, the virus has been restricted to Africa. However, in 2022, a previously unrecognized subclade IIb caused the largest global outbreak of mpox disease with a case fatality rate of ~0.2%. The difference in virulence of MPXV subclades in human infection warrants further investigation, however, one critical limitation is the lack of susceptible small animal models. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of four murine models, including CAST-EiJ and three immunocompromised models (C57BL/6 Ifnar-/-, C57BL/6 Ifngr-/-, and C57BL/6 Ifnar-/-/Ifngr-/-) to MPXV clade IIa (WR 7-61 and US-2003) and IIb (MA-2022) isolates. All four mouse models were susceptible to clade IIa infection, leading to severe disease marked by decreased body temperature, weight loss, and lethality. In contrast, clade IIb infection produced minimal to mild disease at similar doses in all four murine models. The clade IIb isolate produced severe disease (40% lethality) at only the highest dose (8.0 log10 PFU) in the most susceptible immunocompromised mouse model, C57BL/6 Ifnar-/-/Ifngr-/-. This is the first demonstration of lethal disease with clade IIb in a murine model. In addition, these data demonstrate that clade IIa is ~100- to 100,000-fold more virulent than clade IIb and provide three additional murine models for investigating MPXV infection and pathogenesis."

    "content": "ABSTRACT Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous organism that adapts well in different environments. It is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that produces a wide range of virulence factors, colonizes lungs to cause pneumonia, causes non-healing wounds especially in burn victims, and is a major culprit in destructive keratitis. It can reach the cornea through reusable, extended-use contact lenses and by contaminated eyedrops and artificial tears. Secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa together with pyocyanin metabolite, which inhibits Serine Protease Inhibitors (Serpins) activity contribute to severe tissue damage during infection. Methods: P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different clinical sites were obtained from different researchers and clinicians for this study. We examined P. aeruginosa strains and secretion defective and prpL knockout mutants in PA64481 strain for lysyl endopeptidase (PrpL, a serine protease that cleaves after a lysine residue) activity using serine protease specific D-Val-Leu-Lys -p-nitroanalide substrate. We also determined pyocyanin production in these strains. Results: Examination of secreted milieu from P. aeruginosa showed that 41 corneal isolates had detectable lysyl endopeptidase activity associated with PrpL at levels significantly higher than by 27 non-corneal isolates. We found that PrpL is secreted by the xcp-based type II secretion system. Bacterial culture supernatants displaying higher PrpL activity and not low secreted PrpL levels disrupted corneal epithelial cell monolayers in vitro, which is consistent with a role of this protease in destructive keratitis. Many examined strains also produced high levels of pyocyanin. Conclusions: This retrospective examination of clinical P. aeruginosa suggests that high levels of PrpL and pyocyanin-producing isolates are more prevalent among corneal isolates and could enhance tissue damage during infection. Supporting this premise, corneal epithelial cell monolayers disrupted by high PrpL-producing strains but remained intact after treatment with P. aeruginosa mutants culture supernatants that lack or have reduced secreted PrpL."

    "content": "Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their RNA genomes in virus-induced, membrane-bounded organelles. As first found for nodaviruses, the necked cytosolic portals of these organelles bear ringed \"crown\" complexes of viral RNA replication proteins that drive synthesis, capping and release of new RNA genomes. Nodavirus crowns contain two 12-mer rings of viral protein A with C-proximal polymerase domains stacked. In the basal ring, protein As N-proximal RNA capping domains form a central, toroidal floor, while in the apical ring these domains extend radially outward. A third protein A conformation provides a putative central Pol domain interacting with the viral dsRNA replication intermediate in a vesicle beneath the crown. Protein As multiple conformations likely differentially contribute to crown assembly, RNA template recruitment, (-) and (+) strand synthesis, RNA capping, and progeny RNA release. Protein As high copy numbers may provide robustness to these processes. To test such concepts, we combined mutational, complementation and functional analyses. Strong complementation between null mutants in protein As polymerase and RNA capping active sites showed that they operate in independent protein A copies, likely at distinct sites. Thus, neither function is required in all protein A copies, nor are both required in any single copy. Lack of complementation between mutants in distinct RNA capping steps implied that major RNA capping steps must be performed in the same protein. Although RNA polymerase and capping activity were not required in all protein A subunits, none of a series of deletions across these domains were complementable, showing the importance of structural and other requirements for crown assembly, etc. Surprisingly, RNA replication was more sensitive to depleting the fraction of subunits retaining protein As C-terminal intrinsically disordered region than polymerase or capping activity. These and other results reveal and illuminate the cooperative, interdependent nature of protein As diverse functions."

    "content": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a key regulatory system in Vibrio campbellii that modulates virulence and communal behaviours. This study investigated the early transcriptional responses to a quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) and tetracycline using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Following one hour of exposure, 130 and 539 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified under QSI and tetracycline treatments, respectively. Quorum sensing inhibitory activities leading to upregulation of sulfur and porphyrin metabolism genes and downregulation of transporters and QS-related pathways, while tetracycline exposure induced genes related to ribosomal activity, DNA replication, and stress responses. KEGG and GO enrichment analyses revealed distinct pathway regulatory patterns, including in quorum sensing, two-component systems, and biofilm formation. These results highlight the mechanistic distinctions in bacterial response to quorum sensing interference versus antibiotic stress, emphasizing the potential of QSIs as precision anti-virulence agents that modulate pathogenic behaviour while minimizing the selective pressure associated with conventional antibiotics."

    "content": "The global hadal trenches that reside more than 6000 meters below the sea level, represent one of Earth's most remote ecosystems, potentially harboring a microbial reservoir for antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the global hadal environments remain the least investigated ecosystem for ARB/ARG compositions and distribution. This study took three-fold approaches to investigate the ARB/ARGs in the global hadal trench sediments, i.e., large-scale cultivation to isolate and verify ARB/ARGs from Challenger Deep sediments, metagenomic analysis of sediment samples from Challenger Deep over a six-year period, and comparative study of resistomes across six hadal trenches through metagenomic analysis. The Challenger Deep sediments had a consistent average ARG abundance of 0.02 copy/cell over a six-year period, whereas some ARG subtypes fluctuated and showed distinct temporal dynamics. Large-scale screening of ARB via microbial cultivation using 13 classes of antibiotics led to enriching distinct ARB, for which eleven genera were identified by metagenomic sequencing as major host for ARGs. The global hadal trench sediments showed a variable ARG abundance, which was significantly lower than those from environments in proximity to human activities, representing a relatively pristine reservoir. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the hadal ARGs underwent niche-specific selections and formed hadal trench-specific clusters that diverged from human-associated lineages, which can be outward transported when disturbed. The study established the hadal trench sediments, as a relatively pristine reservoir of natural ARGs, providing a crucial environmental baseline for assessing their impacts on the ecosystems and public health risks."

    "content": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles are initially released from the cell in an immature state that cannot cause infection. The proteolytic processing of the Gag structural polyprotein into its individual components triggers a dramatic structural reorganisation that produces fully mature and infectious virions. HIV-1 maturation remodels the Gag lattice to enable membrane fusion, but how early proteolytic steps regulate the envelope glycoprotein (Env) organisation is unknown. Although cryo-electron tomography has defined structural intermediates of global maturation, it has not resolved how Env conformers relate to specific early maturation states. Here, we show that partial Gag cleavage, prior to capsid formation, allosterically reorganises the membrane-proximal lattice, promoting Env clustering and fusion-competent conformations. Using native virus preparations combined with novel cryogenic fluorescence-lifetime imaging correlated to cryo-electron tomography, we map Env conformational signatures onto defined Gag-processing intermediates. This reveals an unrecognised early maturation stage in which incomplete Gag processing primes Env for entry, shifting current models by positioning functional Env activation upstream of core maturation. These results establish that early lattice remodelling is a key determinant of HIV-1 fusion competence and expose a previously inaccessible, intervention-sensitive step with implications for therapeutic and vaccine strategies targeting maturation-entry coupling."

Here, we characterise the PP2C domain of the AC Cac1 in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Structural and biochemical analyses show that Cac1-PP2C adopts a non-canonical scaffold but functions as a Ser/Thr-specific metalloenzyme. Deletion of the PP2C or AC catalytic (ACC) domain demonstrated that PP2C is required for full Cac1 activity, influencing melanin and capsule synthesis, sexual differentiation, titan cell formation, and cell wall integrity. Notably, the PP2C-null mutant induced Th2-biased immunity and extensive pulmonary damage yet failed to cause mortality in mice. Integrated transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses further revealed shared and domain-specific signalling outputs mediated by PP2C and ACC. This study provides the first comprehensive characterisation of a fungal AC-linked PP2C domain and defines its pivotal role in C. neoformans pathobiology."

    "content": "The infant gut microbiome develops during the first years of life and influences long-term health through its interaction with immune system development. However, our understanding of early-life microbiome assembly is biased by the predominance of infants with industrialized lifestyles from North America and Europe. Here, we address this bias by assembling a globally representative dataset of infant gut microbiomes to train a microbiome maturation model that can characterize lifestyle specific patterns of microbial maturation as a function of age. Models trained exclusively on industrialized infants perform poorly when applied to non-industrialized datasets. In contrast, more diverse models including individuals from both lifestyles achieve increased correlation between microbial and chronological age. We identified differences in relevant taxa associated with the maturation in the different lifestyles. Additionally, our modeling approach detects a delay in the microbial maturation of independent cohorts of severely malnourished and preterm infants compared to healthy ones. Our results underscore the relevance of global diversity in microbiome research and provide deeper insights into context-dependent maturation dynamics of the infant gut microbiome."

Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota dysbiosis in both conditions, yet microbial associations with their co-occurrence remain unexplored. Methods: A total of 68 girls (18 normal, 25 PP-only, 18 obesity-only, and 7 obesity-PP comorbidity) were enrolled. 16S rRNA sequencing was applied to determine gut microbiota of girls. Microbial diversity, composition, and differential abundant taxa were analyzed. Results: While overall microbial diversity and community structure were similar across groups, obesity-only subjects exhibited significantly increased microbial richness (Chao1 index, P<0.01 vs. all groups), characterized by a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio (P<0.001 vs. normal/PP), increased Proteobacteria (P<0.001 vs. normal), and enrichment of genera including Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Anaerostipes, Haemophilus, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group (P<0.05 vs. other groups). PP-only subjects showed reduced Verrucomicrobiota (P<0.001 vs. normal/obesity) and elevated Escherichia_Shigella (P<0.05 vs. normal). Most strikingly, the obesity-PP comorbid group exhibited a unique gut microbiota profile characterized by a dramatic depletion of Firmicutes compared to the obesity-only group (P<0.001) and a remarkable nearly 100-fold increase in Verrucomicrobiota abundance (P<0.001 vs. other groups), suggesting a distinct microbial ecotype potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of this comorbidity. Conclusion: This study delineated unique gut microbiota alterations associated with isolated obesity, isolated PP, and their comorbidity in girls. The distinct dysbiotic pattern in comorbid obesity-PP suggested complex microbiota-host interactions, providing a new microbiological perspective for understanding the mechanism of comorbidity between obesity and precocious puberty."

    "content": "Emerging zoonoses remain a global public health concern. Surveillance of infectious and vector-borne diseases is vital for predicting and mitigating detrimental effects of zoonotic spillover events. Beyond assessing what microorganisms are circulating in specific environments, it is important to understand how potential reservoir hosts, especially animals such as bats, participate in pathogen transmission. Bats can host and potentially spread infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. However, bats can also act as bioindicators that test positive for pathogenic microorganisms without necessarily contributing to the pathogen replication cycle. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) provides an efficient means to broadly screen for pathogens, although microorganism selectivity can sometimes be lower than targeted approaches. Pairing mNGS results with higher-sensitivity tests such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) can validate results and together these tools provide a relatively fast and reliable method for conducting surveillance. To test this approach, we surveyed the types of microorganisms circulating in Belize by collecting 263 blood samples from 20 different bat species captured in the Orange Walk District in 2019, 2022, and 2023. We used mNGS to initially characterize the microbial communities and qPCR to confirm presence and intensity of human pathogens of interest. We detected 1,430 different microorganisms with some relevance to human or animal health, including the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi which was detected in the phyllostomid bats Desmodus rotundus and Artibeus jamaicensis. qPCR confirmed the presence and intensity of Trypanosoma cruzi in mNGS-positive bat samples. We documented the types of pathogenic microorganisms circulating throughout the bat community in northern Belize to demonstrate the capacity for bats to serve as bioindicators."

    "content": "Interspecies transmission of human influenza A viruses (FLUAV) to swine occurs frequently, yet the molecular factors driving adaptation remain poorly understood. Here we investigated how vaccine-induced immunity shapes the evolution of a human-origin H3N2 virus in pigs using an in vivo sustained transmission model. Pigs (seeders) were vaccinated with a commercial inactivated swine vaccine and then infected with an antigenically distinct FLUAV containing human-origin HA/NA. Contact pigs were introduced two days later. After 3 days, seeder pigs were removed, and new contacts introduced. This was repeated for a total of 4 contacts. Sequencing of nasal swab samples showed the emergence of mutations clustered near the HA receptor binding site, enabling immune escape and abolishing binding to N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Mutant viruses recognized 2,6-sialosides with 3 N-acetyllactosamine repeats, which are rare in swine lungs, while the parental virus bound structures with a minimum of 2 repeats. Adaptative HA mutations enhanced avidity for 2,6-linked sialic acid, likely compensating for the low abundance of extended glycans. Notably, residues outside the canonical HA binding pocket contribute to glycan binding, suggesting a trade-off between receptor breadth and avidity. These findings show that non-neutralizing immunity promotes viral adaptation by fine-tuning receptor engagement and immune evasion."

    "content": "Methane emissions from ruminants can be expressed through several metrics as total production, yield, or intensity, each reflecting distinct aspects of energy utilization. Among these, methane intensity defined as grams of methane emitted per kilograms of energy-corrected milk, directly links emissions to productive efficiency; however, the microbial mechanisms underlying variation in this trait remain unclear. Here, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to characterize rumen microbial identity, functional potential, and transcriptional activity in lactating cows differing in methane intensity while sharing breed and diet. Microbial community composition and diversity were comparable across phenotypes. However, rumen microbial gene expression revealed marked functional divergence. The rumen content of low-methane intensity cows showed enriched transcription of fructan-degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes and butyrate-forming pathways, primarily encoded by RUG440 (Atopobiaceae) and Sodaliphilus-affiliated metagenome-assembled genomes. These functions suggest a fructan-butyrate metabolic axis supported by potential cross-feeding between primary degraders and butyrate producers. Conversely, the high-methane intensity rumen exhibited greater transcription of pectin-degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes, mainly carried by Prevotella metagenome-assembled genomes, suggesting methyl-ester hydrolysis and methanol release. Despite higher methanogenesis transcript levels in high-methane intensity cows, total methane production did not differ between groups. Together, these findings reveal two contrasting functional configurations of the rumen microbiome in Norwegian Red dairy cattle: a fructan-butyrate-oriented metabolism in low-methane intensity cows and a pectin-methanol-oriented metabolism in high-methane intensity counterparts. This study provides genome-resolved, multi-omic evidence that microbial carbohydrate specialization and fermentation routing contribute to methane intensity phenotypes in dairy cows, offering mechanistic insights for improving ruminant climate efficiency."

However, their respective host ranges and pathogenic behaviours remain poorly resolved, and it is unclear whether their occurrence across hosts reflects true specialisation or ecological opportunism. Limited genetic differentiation among these closely related taxa further complicates their classification as primary necrotrophs or secondary colonisers. In this study, we analysed natural populations of small-spored Alternaria from Germany, Poland, and Serbia using molecular phylogenetics, morphological characterisation, and controlled infection assays to clarify species identity, host associations, and pathogenic potential. Both A. alternata and A. arborescens were detected across all regions and hosts, indicating broad distribution and ecological overlap. The two species were consistently isolated from foliar lesions and were each capable of causing characteristic Alternaria Brown-Spot (ABS) symptoms, thereby fulfilling Kochs postulates. Phylogenetic analyses based on Alt A1 and RPB2 loci resolved two well-supported species clades and revealed extensive haplotype sharing across more than 1300 km, multiple hosts, and diverse climates, suggesting high gene flow and limited population structure. The consistent co-occurrence and comparable pathogenicity of A. alternata and A. arborescens underscore their equal ecological relevance and redefine their roles in ABS epidemiology. These findings indicate that perceived differences in host specialisation may be overstated and that both species contribute equally to Alternaria Brown-Spot epidemics in solanaceous crops."

However, emerging evidence indicates that some bacteria can antagonise viral infection, although the host responses driving this process remains unclear. Using infant mice co-infected with the nasopharyngeal inhabitant and pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) to model antagonistic interactions, we found that prior bacterial colonisation enhances and prolongs anti-viral immune responses during co-infection, compared with viral infection alone. Transcriptomic, immunological, and histological analyses showed that pneumococcal colonisation prior to PVM infection enhanced and prolonged interferon signalling, increased anti-viral cytokine and chemokine protein levels and CD8+ cell responses. Notably, over 50% of differentially expressed host genes during co-infection were not differentially expressed in either infection alone. Our work shows that bacterial colonisation can modulate host immunity, shaping how the immune system responds to incoming viral infections, which has the potential to open novel therapeutic applications."

    "content": "Forecasting encounters between humans and large carnivores has largely relied on mechanistic models driven by causal factors such as food resources and weather. However, for short-term forecasting these approaches implicitly require unrealistically detailed real-time data on many covariates and an almost complete understanding of the underlying causal pathways. As a result, they offer little practical support for short-term, operational decision-making. We developed a short-term forecasting system that predicts end-of-month cumulative bear sightings from the beginning of each month by exploiting temporal autocorrelation without mechanistic assumptions, using an ensemble of multiple components: (i) sequential estimation of daily sighting rates via a non-stationary Poisson process, (ii) seasonal baselines with ratio-based corrections from previous months, and (iii) rule-based transitions among components as daily sightings accumulate. Applied to Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) sighting records from two Japanese regions differing 18-fold in encounter frequency (maximum monthly counts: 83 vs. 1490) and with contrasting seasonal peaks, the ensemble achieved correlations of > 0.8 between predicted and observed month-end totals from day 1, increasing to > 0.98 by day 20 and substantially outperforming a null model that assumed no seasonal or interannual variation (delta AIC: 477-652). After controlling for baseline spatial risk and for the region-wide daily bear-forecast level (temporal risk) provided by our ensemble, we detected strongly localized short-term recurrence in bear encounters: prior sightings increased encounter probability within 500 m for up to 3 days, with rapid decay in space and time. Synthesis and applications. This observation-based ensemble demonstrates that temporal dynamics alone can approach the practical limits of short-term predictability of wildlife encounter rates, without relying on detailed environmental covariates or extensive new data collection. By quantifying both when (daily risk levels) and where (localized hotspots around recent sightings) encounters are most likely, the system offers wildlife agencies and residents an immediately implementable tool for issuing targeted warnings, adjusting outdoor activities, and reducing human injuries in regions experiencing increasing human-carnivore conflict."

    "content": "Widespread declines in insect diversity and abundance underscore an urgent need for standardized, nonlethal monitoring methods for important pollinators such as bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Camera traps are widely used for non-intrusive, continuous surveys of large animals but have not yet been extensively adopted for monitoring insects. An automated camera trap system could improve current insect survey methods, which often rely on lethal traps or in-person observation. We developed an open-source, low-cost camera trap for monitoring wild insects and evaluated its performance relative to established sampling approaches. The system used a low-power microcomputer to collect time-lapse images on colored platforms. We trained whole-image and tiled deep-learning object detection models to detect insects in images captured by the traps. We found that tiled inference models significantly improved detection accuracy and outperformed human review. Bumble bee visitation was highest on platforms featuring a fluorescent bullseye pattern; adding a fluorescent coat to blue platforms increased visitation modestly. With continuous monitoring, the cameras recorded bumble bee visits during all daylight hours. Over 18 days, camera traps recorded six Bombus species, yielding community composition and diversity estimates comparable to those obtained by hand netting and blue vane traps. Using our observed data, we simulated the effect of deploying variable numbers of cameras at sites with distinct levels of diversity. Adding cameras substantially increased sampling completeness, particularly in species-rich communities. Our findings demonstrate that low-cost, automated camera traps paired with deep-learning image analysis can enable scalable, nonlethal studies of bumble bee diversity and behavior. Our work establishes a foundation for monitoring other diurnal insect communities."

Ten rigorous studies showed no significant SOC change, yet thirteen less robust studies suggested SOC increases. This divergence highlights that low-quality evidence is prevalent, underscoring a critical need for stronger evidence before asserting climate change mitigation benefits from alternative grazing practices."

    "content": "Mosquitoes locate vertebrate hosts by following coherent gradients of carbon dioxide, heat, and humidity. Nevertheless, a persistent empirical observation is that ordinary electric fans drastically reduce mosquito bites, even in the absence of chemical repellents. Here, we introduce a physics-guided, agent-based simulation demonstrating that mosquito host-seeking is not chemically inevitable but physically fragile. The model integrates directional airflow, vortex-induced chaotic mixing, and thermal decoy fields, and tracks 250 autonomous mosquito agents over 600 time-steps under Monte-Carlo sampling without fixed random seeds. Three aerodynamic mechanisms were quantified. Mild upward airflow already reduces successful host localization by more than 80 percent, despite not mechanically preventing flight. Increasing vortex circulation produces a continuous phase transition, collapsing localization probability below 1 percent at moderate strength. Thermal decoys cause only a linear dilution of success, indicating that misinformation alone cannot trigger collapse. A two-dimensional phase map reveals a robust \"invisibility region\" where airflow and vortex perturbations interact multiplicatively, eliminating host detection even when neither factor individually reaches threshold. These results show that mosquito host-seeking operates as a gradient-dependent failure system: once scalar fields lose spatial coherence, navigation collapses independent of sensory capability. This provides a quantitative theoretical basis for fan-mediated mosquito protection and suggests that non-chemical, low-energy airflow strategies can induce physical invisibility to hematophagous insects."

    "content": "The surface ocean exhibits strong vertical gradients in light, nutrients, and temperature, shaping the phytoplankton distribution which often defines a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria inhabit the euphotic zone, with their abundances following the chlorophyll a variability. While AAP bacterial communities are known to differ across regions with contrasting environmental conditions, their vertical distribution remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the diversity and community structure of AAP bacteria would vary across the vertical gradient, in relation to changes in environmental variables and following the DCM profile. To test this hypothesis, we studied the composition of AAP communities at different depths along the DCM structure in the South and Central Atlantic Ocean, by means of amplicon sequencing of the pufM gene. The results show significant differences in richness, community structure and taxonomic composition of samples from different layers of the DCM, highlighting the dependance of AAP bacteria on its structure. Remarkably, the use of primers with broad phylogenetic coverage enabled the recovery of several phylogroups previously detected only through metagenomics. We show that they represent a significant fraction of marine AAP communities, we provide clues on their ecological preferences, and confirm their association with the family Candidatus Luxescamonaceae, with genomic potential for carbon fixation."

    "content": "A central question in animal behavior is how individual phenotypes shape, and are shaped by, dominance hierarchies. Using clownfish (Amphiprion percula) as a model system, we investigated how individuals strategically modify their phenotype during hierarchy formation. We tested the overarching hypothesis that interactions among size- and age-matched rivals will lead to the emergence of social roles (dominant, subordinate, solitary), accompanied by divergence in four aspects of individual phenotypes: growth, feeding behavior, agonistic behaviors (aggression, submission), and gene expression. To test this, we created 30 replicates of juvenile clownfish, each comprising a size-matched pair housed together, and a solitary size-matched individual housed separately. Our results show that an individuals social context shapes its growth trajectory through coordinated changes in feeding behavior, agonistic behaviors, and gene expression. Individuals emerging as dominant within pairs grew twice as much compared to those emerging as subordinates, while subordinate and solitary individuals showed comparable growth. Initially, paired individuals consumed more food per capita than solitary individuals, but this difference declined as size hierarchies became established. Agonistic behaviors also decreased over time among paired individuals as size differences emerged. Transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of conserved vertebrate growth pathways and ossification related genes, and downregulation of satiety-associated genes, in dominant individuals compared to subordinates and solitaries. Here we link changes in gene expression with growth and feeding behavior regulation that underpin and reinforce social role differentiation during dominance hierarchy formation in clownfish. Our findings lay the foundation for a broader framework to explore the mechanisms underpinning strategic growth in social vertebrates."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.09.693207v1?rss=1",
    "content": "Realising the potential for acoustic monitoring to deliver biodiversity insight at scale requires new approaches to the automated analysis of PAM recordings that are trustworthy as well as cost-effective. Discriminative models trained on annotated species data are gaining popularity but are labour intensive, notoriously opaque and biased. Self-supervised generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) offer great potential for learning compact yet expressive representations of data, which can be used for subsequent discriminative tasks and are intrinsically interpretable. However, the default learning algorithm results in weakly discriminative data representations due to under-specification of the generative task. We propose and evaluate a novel modification to the VAE learning algorithm that models intra-frame shift-invariance. We demonstrate that this modification provides representations that are more interpretable, consistent and improve classification performance. Performance accuracy is evaluated on species detection tasks on two weakly annotated data sets across temperate and tropical terrestrial habitats and compared to leading discriminative models BirdNet and Perch, as well as the classic VAE. Whilst demonstrated in terrestrial recordings, the approach is transferable to marine, freshwater, and soil habitats. These innovations set the path for trustworthy, data and time-efficient tools to support solid ecological inference from large-scale passive acoustic monitoring surveys."

    "content": "In autumn 2025, an unprecedented mass mortality event was observed among the western migrating subpopulation of Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) in Germany. Systemic infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype DI.2.1, was identified as the cause of acute death. The gregarious behavior of cranes at feeding and resting sites likely has contributed to the rapid and massive dissemination of viruses within the crane population."

    "content": "This study reports the first confirmed records of Culex (Culex) acharistus, Root, 1927 in Bolivia, based on both morphological examination and biomolecular identification using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) marker. Specimens were collected in four localities representing diverse environmental settings: La Paz (urban environment, {approx}3600 m), the nearby high-altitude city of El Alto ({approx}4000 m), Cochabamba (semi-rural and urban habitats, {approx}2600 m), and Licoma a large village in the Yungas region (subtropical environment, {approx}1900 m). The larval habitats where the species was found closely match those reported in neighboring countries where Cx. acharistus also occurs, ranging from typical small peridomestic sites to ponds, ditches, and river seepages in semi-rural areas. All identification methods yielded unambiguous results, confirming the species presence in Bolivia and extending its known distribution in South America. This finding highlights the importance of integrating morphological and molecular approaches to achieve accurate and reliable mosquito species identification."

    "content": "Pollen monitoring is crucial for understanding seasonal patterns, supporting allergy diagnosis and informing early-warning tools to mitigate allergic diseases. The Southern Hemisphere lacks long-term data on pollen seasons, with extremely few from Africa. We present pollen calendars based on five-year data from the South African Pollen Monitoring Network (SAPNET). Airborne pollen from 2019 to 2024 in biomes across South Africa was collected using Hirst-type volumetric spore traps and standard protocols. Daily concentrations were analysed by light microscopy. The five-year mean annual pollen integral (APIn, pollen grains/cubic meter per year) was calculated for each site. The five-year mean APIn was highest in the Grassland Biome (Bloemfontein, 11654 pg/cubic meter; range 8515 to 14454 pg/cubic meter) and lowest in the Albany Thicket Biome (Gqeberha, 1372; range 853 to 2010 pg/cubic meter). The Grassland Biome (Johannesburg) had the highest averaged tree pollen concentration (7558; range 6575 to 8803 pg/cubic meter). The Savanna Biome (Kimberley) had the highest average grass pollen concentration (3150; 1826 to 3785 pg/cubic meter). The grass family (Poaceae) was the most common pollen type across all biomes. Other common contributing taxa were exotic trees Cupressaceae, Platanus, Morus and Betula. Tree seasons were July to September, whilst grass and weed pollen seasons varied across the different biomes. These five-year pollen calendars provide the first biome-specific national reference for airborne pollen exposure in South Africa. The findings provide baseline data for the clinical management of allergic disease."
